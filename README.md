## 🛡️ Privacy by Design

- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** API requests go directly from your machine to the provider. No middleman.
- **Local-First Storage:** All data stays on your machine in `~/.skales-data`.
- **Offline Capable:** With Ollama, Skales works entirely offline.
- **Sandboxed Autonomy:** File operations run in a workspace sandbox.

> ⚠️ Skales can browse the web, execute commands, and manage files on your behalf. Always review what you ask it to do.

## 📖 The Story

Skales started in early 2025 as a bloated Laravel SaaS project. I scrapped it all and rebuilt it via "Vibe Coding" - the result is a local-first AI companion that feels like a real product, not a developer tool.

I'm **Mario Simic** - 10+ years in Marketing & Design. I know how software should look and feel. I got tired of agents that require Terminal setups and Docker containers. So I built something better.

### 🏆 Credits

- **Claude & Google Gemini** - For powering the Vibe Coding workflow.
- **OpenRouter** - The best hub for accessing the world's greatest LLMs.
