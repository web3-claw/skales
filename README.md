### What's New in v6.1.0 - "The Awakening"

Autopilot is now a true autonomous agent. It generates recurring schedules from your goals,
delivers daily stand-up reports via Telegram, pauses for approval instead of silently skipping,
and lets you watch it think in real-time via the new Live Execution View.

Meet **💧 Bubbles** - the new mascot skin. A playful blue blob that morphs into shapes.

Plus: Feedback system, 13 bug fixes, GDPR telemetry fix, and a redesigned admin dashboard.

## What's New in v6.0.2

- **Telegram Approval Overhaul** - Text-based approval replaces unreliable inline keyboards. Unrestricted mode now correctly bypasses approval. Agent no longer hallucinates tool execution when blocked
- **GDPR Telemetry Fix** - Zero network requests when telemetry opt-in is disabled. Defense-in-depth check at API route level
- **Orphaned Tool Results** - Sanitization removes stale tool_result blocks before API calls, preventing 400 errors
- **Replicate Image Save** - Generated images now properly download and save to workspace
- **Bubbles Mascot** - New mascot skin: a blue liquid blob. Select in Settings → Desktop Buddy
- **Telegram Reset** - New "Reset All" button purges all Telegram data for a fresh start

## What's New in v6.0.1

- **Agent Execution Mandate** - Agent now acts immediately instead of explaining what it could do. Platform-aware commands: PowerShell on Windows, bash on macOS
- **Safety Mode Simplified** - Two levels only: Safe (all actions require approval) and Unrestricted (full autonomy)
- **Approval Loop Fix** - After approval, the agent continues the ReAct loop until the task is complete
- **Telegram Fixes** - Real messages instead of raw translation keys, Approve/Decline buttons fixed, markdown cleaned before sending
- **Replicate API Fix** - Official models now use the correct endpoint
- **Enhanced Telemetry** - Tool usage, provider, language, feature usage tracked (opt-in, with deduplication)

## What's New in v6.0


- **4 Languages** - Full UI in English, Deutsch, Espanol, and Francais. Language picker on first launch, switcher always in Settings
- **Replicate (BYOK)** - 50+ image and video models with one API key. SDXL, FLUX, Stable Video Diffusion, and more
- **Custom AI Endpoint** - Connect llama.cpp, LM Studio, vLLM, koboldcpp, or any OpenAI-compatible server. Includes tool-calling toggle for local models
- **Buddy Tool Execution** - The Desktop Buddy can now DO things, not just answer questions. Write files, send emails, browse, manage calendar - all from the buddy overlay. Approve/Decline buttons appear inside the speech bubble for actions that need confirmation
- **Dynamic Buddy Skins** - Full skin system. Create a folder in `public/mascot/<name>/`, add your .webm clips, restart Skales. The skin selector appears automatically in Settings when more than one skin is installed
- **Anonymous Telemetry (opt-in)** - Off by default. Prompted during onboarding. Only collects: app version, OS type, start/crash events. No conversations, no API keys, no personal data
- **In-app Bug Reporting** - Report Bug button in the sidebar. Reports sent to the developer with optional system info. Local fallback if offline
- **Buddy Flicker Fix** - Eliminated 300-500ms blank flash between animations using direct DOM opacity sync with requestVideoFrameCallback
- **Skales+ Teaser** - Tier comparison page with waitlist. All features stay free and unlocked during beta
- **Approval System** - Tool safety default changed to 'confirm'. create_document tool added. Telegram inline buttons fixed
- **Build Automation** - post-nextjs-build.js automates standalone asset copy and mascot folder verification

## 🛡️ Privacy by Design

- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** API requests go directly from your machine to the provider. No middleman.
- **Local-First Storage:** All data stays on your machine in `~/.skales-data`.
- **Offline Capable:** With Ollama, Skales works entirely offline.
- **Sandboxed Autonomy:** File operations run in a workspace sandbox.

> ⚠️ Skales can browse the web, execute commands, and manage files on your behalf. Always review what you ask it to do.

## 📖 The Story

Skales started in early 2025 as a bloated Laravel SaaS project. I scrapped it all and rebuilt it as a native desktop app - the result is a local-first AI companion that feels like a real product, not a developer tool.

I'm **Mario Simic** - 10+ years in Marketing & Design. I know how software should look and feel. I got tired of agents that require Terminal setups and Docker containers. So I built something better.

### 🏆 Credits

- **Claude & Google Gemini** - For powering the development workflow.
- **OpenRouter** - The best hub for accessing the world's greatest LLMs.
