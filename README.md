## 📖 The Story

Skales started in early 2025 as a bloated Laravel SaaS project. I scrapped it all and rebuilt it as a native desktop app - the result is a local-first AI companion that feels like a real product, not a developer tool.

I'm **Mario Simic** - 10+ years in Marketing & Design. I got tired of agents that require Terminal setups and Docker containers. So I built something better.

### Credits

- **Claude & Google Gemini** - For powering the development workflow.
- **OpenRouter** - The best hub for accessing the world's greatest LLMs.
