# **Changelog**

All notable changes to Skales will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## v10.3.1

A maintenance release that cleans up the rough edges users hit on v10.3.0. Nothing new on the surface; the things that already worked now work the way the screens promised.

### Fixed

- **Custom Folders survive mode switches.** Saving settings while in Workspace Only or Unrestricted mode used to wipe the configured Custom Folders list. Switching to Custom mode would then show an empty list even though the user had configured paths. The list is now persisted in every mode.
- **OS notifications respect the Friend Mode OS-notify toggle.** Every incoming Telegram message used to fire a native desktop toast regardless of the user's Friend Mode setting. The inbox poller now reads the same channel preference the proactive heartbeat does, so OS toasts stay off when the user asked for them to stay off.
- **Telegram replies are tagged "via Telegram" instead of "via Desktop Buddy".** The first reply in a session was tagged correctly; the second and every subsequent reply was relabelled "via Desktop Buddy" because the polling code rewrote the source field. The original source is now preserved on every turn.
- **MCP Start actually starts the server.** The Start button on the MCP page used to only flip an internal enabled flag and wait for some other code path to lazily open a connection, which is why the status stayed "Stopped / 0 tools" even after clicking Start. Start now spawns the process and lists tools immediately, the same way Test does. Stop kills the running process without touching the saved config.
- **MCP Edit opens a pre-filled form in edit mode.** Clicking Edit on an existing MCP server used to navigate to an empty Add form. The form is now pre-filled with the server's current name, command, args, and environment variables; the button reads "Save changes" and there is a Cancel option to back out without persisting.
- **MCP template tiles pre-fill the Add form.** Clicking a template tile on the empty-state MCP page now actually fills in the command and arguments for that template instead of dropping the user on a blank form.
- **MCP Logs button works.** The Logs drawer previously hit a 404 because the underlying API route was missing. The route is now in place and returns the captured stdout and stderr lines for the selected server.
- **MCP configs with a combined command string work on macOS and Linux.** A config like `"command": "npx -y obsidian-mcp-server@latest"` with empty args used to work only on Windows (where the spawn ran through a shell). On macOS and Linux it failed because spawn treated the whole string as the binary name. The combined form is now split at spawn time, so configs written by hand, by deep-link, or imported from another tool work on all three platforms.
- **Desktop Buddy drag stays smooth across the whole screen.** The mascot used to lose drag capture on Linux as soon as the cursor escaped the buddy window's pixel bounds, stranding it after about a third of the screen height. Drag now uses pointer capture, which works the same way on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Desktop Buddy snaps back to a visible display.** If the saved position lands off every connected display (multi-monitor disconnect, a sleep / wake cycle with displays rearranged, or a wrong primary-display pick at startup), the buddy is moved back to the primary display's bottom-right corner on the next show.
- **Desktop Buddy on Linux lets clicks through the transparent area.** The bottom-right rectangle around the mascot used to block clicks from reaching the desktop underneath, because Linux Electron hit-tests transparent windows at the OS level. The buddy now passes clicks through wherever the mascot, the speech bubble, and the input pill are not.


## v10.3.0

A power-user release. Skales lands its first genuinely native organisational surface (the Project Tracker), a working RAG primer, a real command palette, Friend Mode that actually fires, a summarize flow that returns inline infographics instead of escaped HTML, and a manual /cast page so DLNA can finally be debugged outside the LLM tool path. The minor-version bump is for the Project Tracker - it changes "what Skales is for" enough that 10.2.x would have understated it.

### Added

- **Project Tracker (`/projects`).** Linear-style local workflow inside Skales. Each project carries a title, description, status (idea / planning / in_progress / paused / done), priority, tags, **optional deadline** (renders a green / amber / red progress bar with "X days left" / "Overdue by X day(s)" caption), milestone list, a Markdown notes file, **attachments** (up to 10 MB each), and a suggestedTools array. From the detail view, "Discuss with AI" or "Start working" launches a chat session scoped to the project — system message carries the notes, open milestones, and suggested tools. From chat: `/projects` (list), `/projects new "Title" | desc` (create), `/projects status "Title" → in_progress` (move), `/projects open "Title"` (jump in) — Skales creates / lists / moves projects directly from chat. Empty state renders the same 2-column shell as the populated view so the first project does not cause a layout shift. Storage is local-only at `~/.skales-data/projects/`. Designed to converge with v11 Recurring Autonomous Tasks (Issue #104) — the data model is exactly what an agent dispatcher will want.
- **Friend Mode is alive again.** Proactive check-ins broke when Buddy Mode landed in v8/v9: the autonomous-runner heartbeat only started when Autopilot was on, so users who enabled only Friend Mode saw Skales go silent. The heartbeat now starts whenever Friend Mode is enabled, and toggling the master switch in Settings mirrors the change to the running process in real time.
- **WhatsApp + Email channels for Friend Mode.** Both wired through `tickFriendMode` and the buddy-intelligence notification router. WhatsApp sends to the first permitted contact; Email sends to the user's own configured address. The "Coming Soon" placeholder is replaced with a real working toggle.
- **Cmd+K / Ctrl+K command palette.** Global fuzzy launcher across every visible nav item, every settings tab, and the 20 most recent chat sessions. Suppressed in buddy / spotlight / bootstrap windows.
- **/search command in chat.** Full-text scan over every saved session JSON file. Magnifier icon in the bottom-left composer toolbar prefills the composer. Results render inline as ranked snippets with one-click links back to the original chat.
- **/rag command + local Knowledge Base.** Paste documents on /memory (new Knowledge Base card); content is chunked (~220 words, 40-word overlap) and indexed with BM25-lite. `/rag <query>` in chat returns the top-5 chunks with source labels and scores. No embedding model, no external services; local-only storage.
- **Summarize style topbar.** Click the summarize button and a topbar appears with four output styles: text / markdown / HTML infographic / Jina-extract-then-summarize. The HTML mode renders inside a sandboxed iframe inline in chat and the prompt enforces an Anthropic-style aesthetic (warm off-white background, near-black body, ONE accent colour, serif headings + sans body — no neon, no playful gradients). The user's composer stays clean: the instruction wrapper attaches to the outgoing message at send time, never visible while typing.
- **/cast page.** Manual surface for DLNA / UPnP discovery + control. Lists every device the SSDP-plus-unicast pipeline finds, shows the raw discovery debug log, casts any HTTP media URL with play / pause / stop. Gated by the `casting` add-on, off by default. The LLM-tool path also still works.
- **13 new bundled templates** across chat / browser / studio / codework / code / planner / organization: Friday Weekly Review, Rubber-Duck Debugger, 2-Option Decision Matrix, Competitor Pricing Scan, Brand Palette Poster, README from Scratch, Deep Work Day Plan, Research+Write Pipeline, Launch Plan Starter, and more.
- **Knowledge Graph visualization.** The KG data store has existed since v9 with entity types and relationships; the only surface was a chip row and a plain-text list. `/memory` now renders a real SVG force-directed-style graph with type-color legend and hover-to-highlight when the KG is enabled.
- **Brand Kit -> Studio image bridge.** Brand colors, tone, and typographic direction are now appended to every image-generation prompt at the API route, falling back to the saved BrandKit on disk if the caller omits it. video-director did this since v8; the still-image path is now at parity.
- **DLNA discovery actually finds devices.** SSDP multicast timeout bumped from 5s to 8s (covers Samsung / LG response delays). The /24 unicast port-scan now runs in parallel with SSDP by default instead of only as a fallback, so dual-band routers no longer under-report.
- Single source of truth for navigation. Sidebar, TopNav, and IconRail read from a shared config — disabled add-ons disappear from all three nav surfaces in real time.
- Add-Ons toggles wired across every UI surface: sidebar, settings tabs, chat tools dropdown, chat quick actions, and the LLM tool manifest.
- One-shot upgrade notification in the Notification Center (not a toast). Explains that add-ons are now toggleable from the sidebar. Dismissed once = never reappears.
- Tolerant session loader handles older session files with legacy tool-call format and aborted-generation entries without breaking chat replay.
- "Powered by GIPHY" and "Powered by Klipy" attribution in Settings, Chat, and Discover Feed.
- Add-Ons page reorganized into tabbed sections: Skales Tools, Communication, Integrations, Computer & Vision.
- Context-size badges next to model names in chat composer and settings (red under 32K, orange 32K-64K, no badge above 64K).
- General settings group: default location and temperature unit. Powers the weather widget and the new in-chat `get_weather` tool.
- Multiple Google Calendar IDs supported. Plus-button in calendar config adds a row, list-aware reads fan out across all calendars. 
(thanks @pono1012 for the original patch)
- Jina Reader as alternative web-text extractor next to Tavily, behind a provider selector in Settings -> Providers.
- DeepSeek accepts `web_search` as an alias for the canonical `search_web` tool name.
- AppImage on Ubuntu 24.04+ falls back to no-sandbox when the kernel restricts unprivileged userns. AppArmor profile snippet in INSTALL-LINUX.md.
- Studio Gallery deletes now persist to disk. Toast on failure.
- Reasoning blocks from llama.cpp and llama-swap render cleanly in chat.
- Consistent "Tool Result" label for tool result blocks.

### Changed

- Memory section moved out of the Security tab.
- Tavily and web extractor selector moved from Integrations to Providers.
- Studio and Integrations tabs consolidated.
- Settings search now matches correctly (multi-token AND-match).
- Memory Consolidation (Dreaming) toggle auto-persists on click; previously it only set local state and never made it to disk, which is why most users never saw a nightly run.
- Sidebar order: Discover lifted above Notifications, Projects lifted above Agents.
- Toasts no longer surface in the buddy desktop pet, the mini-chat overlay, or the spotlight window — they belong only in the main app window.
- Notification action URLs that start with `/` now navigate in the same window instead of opening a new BrowserWindow.
- Set Up Vision Provider button deep-links into Settings instead of routing to Add-Ons.
- Skills renamed to Add-Ons across navigation, page headers, and subtitles. Internal code keys unchanged for backwards compatibility.
- Beta indicators removed everywhere except Studio.
- Tools for unconfigured integrations no longer sent to the model on every request — drastically lower token usage on local 8K-context providers.
- ~250 untranslated placeholders cleaned up across 11 non-English locales.
- `check_capabilities` (the tool Skales uses to answer "what can you do?") now covers Projects, Knowledge Base (RAG), Chat History Search, Command Palette, Hugging Face Spaces, the Jina extractor backend, multi-calendar fan-out, and the default-location weather behaviour.

### Fixed

- Friend Mode never sent a proactive message because the heartbeat that drives it only started when Autopilot was on (root cause regression since v8/v9).
- `/search` magnifier button was only in the mobile-only icon row, so it never rendered on desktop. Moved to the bottom-left composer toolbar.
- Summarize prefix "Summarize this (URL, Text..):" no longer leaks as visible text into the input bar — it's a state flag now, not a string the user has to look at.
- Mixed-language strings in Russian and Chinese gallery confirmation dialogs.
- Hidden `data-test-canvas` div removed from organization page.
- Stale "4 themes total" comment corrected to 6 themes.

### Removed

- Deprecated legacy Custom OpenAI provider section.


## v10.2.12

### Added

- **Friend Mode is alive again.** Proactive check-ins broke when Buddy Mode landed in v8/v9: the autonomous-runner heartbeat only started when Autopilot was on, so users who enabled only Friend Mode saw Skales go silent. The heartbeat now also starts when activeUserBehavior is enabled, and the master toggle on the Settings page mirrors the change to the running process in real time, no app restart needed.
- **WhatsApp + Email channels for Friend Mode.** Both wired through tickFriendMode and the buddy-intelligence notification router. WhatsApp sends to the first permitted contact; Email sends to the user's own configured address. The "Coming Soon" WhatsApp placeholder is replaced with a real working toggle.
- **Cmd+K / Ctrl+K command palette.** Global fuzzy launcher across every visible nav item, every settings tab, and the 20 most recent chat sessions. Suppressed in buddy / spotlight / bootstrap windows.
- **/search command in chat.** Full-text scan over every saved session JSON file. Magnifier icon next to the slash button prefills the composer. Results render inline as ranked snippets with one-click links back to the original chat.
- **/rag command + local Knowledge Base.** Paste documents on /memory (new Knowledge Base card); content is chunked (~220 words, 40-word overlap) and indexed with BM25-lite. /rag <query> in chat returns the top-5 chunks with source labels and scores.

- Single source of truth for navigation. Sidebar, TopNav, and IconRail read from a shared config - disabled add-ons disappear from all three nav surfaces in real time.
- Add-Ons toggles wired across every UI surface: sidebar, settings tabs, chat tools dropdown, chat quick actions, and the LLM tool manifest. Disabling Notion (for example) removes it from everywhere until you turn it back on.
- One-shot upgrade notification in the Notification Center (not a toast). Explains that add-ons are now toggleable from the sidebar. Dismissed once = never reappears.
- Tolerant session loader handles older session files with legacy tool-call format and aborted-generation entries without breaking the chat replay.

## v10.2.9

Hotfix for Organization task lifecycle.

### Bug Fixes

- **Instant abort for Organization tasks.** The Abort button now cancels in-flight LLM API calls within milliseconds via AbortController, instead of waiting up to 300s for the current call to time out. No more wasted tokens on aborted runs.
- **Project deletion stops running tasks.** Deleting a project with an active task now aborts the task before removing the project file, so the underlying Organization task stops cleanly.
- **Orphaned tasks cleaned up on startup.** Tasks left in 'running' state after a crash or restart are marked 'aborted' on next boot, so the UI does not try to resume dead tasks.

### Co-Pilot

Thanks to Niki (@NikiKeyz) for the SkyNet PR.


## v10.2.8

### Skales Mobile is Live on Android

Skales Mobile is now publicly available on the Google Play Store for Android phones and tablets. Connect to your Skales Desktop instance over the encrypted relay for full feature access, or run the standalone mode with 27 native mobile tools. Install from the Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.skales.mobile.

iOS is in review with Apple. The Play Store launch is the public beachhead; iOS lands the moment review clears.

### New Features

- **Memory Mode.** The setting formerly known as Token Compressor is now called Memory Mode, with clearer mode names (Always Remember, Compact, Minimal) and a more intuitive UI. Minimal mode moved behind an Advanced disclosure to prevent accidental selection. When the active mode is non-default, a small amber Brain badge appears in the chat header to surface the state and provide a one-click jump back to settings. Hidden in Mini Mode, matching the established pattern for Voice, Call, Share, and Incognito.
- **Codework resume banner.** When the most-recent Codework session was paused or interrupted, a dismissible resume banner appears at the top of the welcome view with Resume and Dismiss buttons. The banner replaces the previous Continue button as the canonical resume affordance. Dismiss transitions an active session to a stopped state and persists so the banner does not reappear.
- **Codework file-tree toggle.** New header button toggles the file tree pane visibility, with state persisted across restarts.
- **Codework recent sessions sorted by activity.** Recent sessions now sort by last-touched time instead of filename. Status badges expanded to five states: IN PROGRESS, DONE, ERR, STOPPED, or none for unknown.
- **Sidebar agent filter.** The sidebar now filters sessions by the currently selected agent, so clicking a session no longer reroutes to a different agent's context.
- **Open Folder button.** Codework projects now have an Open in Finder / Open in Explorer button in the project header.
- **OpenRouter as default provider.** New installs and first-time setups now default to OpenRouter as the primary provider for faster onboarding.
- **Tasks expand modal.** Long task results no longer truncate silently. Click any task to open a full-text modal.
- **Persona persistence.** Selected persona now persists across conversation restarts.

### Bug Fixes

- **Session write race condition.** Concurrent writers (chat page mid-conversation, buddy poll, mobile bridge, Telegram inbound, Spotlight) could previously clobber each other through a last-writer-wins pattern. A new per-session in-process mutex serializes all writers, and the mobile bridge specifically now re-loads the session at write time instead of overwriting with a pre-call snapshot. Race window shrinks from seconds-to-minutes down to milliseconds, effectively race-free for everyday use. Telemetry warns in DevTools console when an unexpected shrink occurs; Manual Compact logs an "intentional shrink" marker so the two are distinguishable.
- **Tool-only assistant turns no longer vanish.** When an assistant turn carried tool_calls but no captured tool results (interrupted mid-execution, rare race), the chat render filter previously dropped the row entirely. Those turns now render as an italic indicator listing the attempted tool names, preserving the conversation timeline.
- **Skill AI / GPT-5.x consolidation.** Edge cases in the GPT-5.x reasoning detection added in v10.2.7 are consolidated and covered.
- **Tool pruning logic.** A regression in tool-pruning for large conversations is corrected.


### Co-Pilot

Welcome **Niki (@NikiKeyz)** as Skales Co-Pilot. His first contribution landed during the v10.2.8 cycle. 

### Under the Hood

- 14 contributor and 6 public issues closed across the sprint.
- Three coordinated quick-fixes shipped alongside the main sessions.


## v10.2.7

Hotfix for three user-reported regressions surfaced after v10.2.6. No new product surfaces. Auto-updater pipeline unchanged.   Locale parity preserved.

### Bug Fixes

- **OpenAI GPT-5.x models failing with 400 errors.** v10.2.6 detected o1, o3, o4, and bare gpt-5 but missed every GPT-5.x dot-version. Detection now covers the full lineup (gpt-5.1 through gpt-5.5) with every documented suffix (mini, nano, pro, codex, codex-spark, chat-latest, thinking, instant) and every dated snapshot. Detection is also provider-agnostic, so GPT-5.x routed through OpenRouter, Custom Provider, or any OpenAI-compatible relay now sends `max_completion_tokens`, omits `temperature`, and folds `system` into `user` only for o1 family per OpenAI's current API documentation.
- **Custom Provider 404 errors.** The chat completions URL builder now detects existing version segments in your Base URL (like `/v4`, `/v1`, or a full `/chat/completions` path) and avoids appending duplicates. Z.ai (regular, coding, and OpenAI-compat endpoints), Groq, and other providers with non-default URL structures work out of the box. Same detection applies to model-list discovery.
- **Telegram proactive messages returning provider errors.** Friend Mode, Identity Maintenance, daily standup, and cron task completion notifications now share the same body builder as in-app chat. The previous split between the chat path and the Telegram-channel path is gone, so reasoning-model handling, system-message folding, and tool-array formatting stay consistent across every send site (chat, ReAct loop, autonomous-task fallback, and code builder).


## v10.2.6

Mini-release focused on critical user-reported bugs across the OpenAI and Gemini providers, sleep/wake recovery, capabilities awareness, and the Planner. No new product surfaces. Auto-updater pipeline unchanged.  

### Bug Fixes (Critical, User-Reported)

- **OpenAI provider 400 across all models.** OpenAI's chat completions API standardized on `max_completion_tokens` in late 2025; the legacy `max_tokens` field now returns 400 on current GPT models. Reasoning models (o1, o3, o4, gpt-5) additionally reject any non-default `temperature`, and o1 / o1-mini reject `system` role messages entirely. Skales now sends the correct field per model class and folds system content into the first user turn for o1.
- **Gemini tool calling broken (thought_signature missing).** Reasoning-enabled Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash require the `thoughtSignature` Google returns alongside a `functionCall` part to be echoed back on the next turn. The Gemini adapter now captures and round-trips the signature, so multi-turn tool conversations no longer fail with HTTP 400.
- **Sleep / wake white screen.** Returning from system suspend or unlocking the screen no longer leaves the Skales window stuck on a blank page with "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred". Added `powerMonitor` listeners on suspend, resume, and unlock-screen that reload all live windows after a short delay so networking is fully back before the renderer fires its first request.
- **Capabilities awareness.** Skales is now aware of its own runtime UI features in the system prompt: KaTeX math rendering, HTML preview, code-block copy with `Ctrl+A` scoping, edit / branch / delete on user messages, manual compact, token-split tooltip, MCP servers, and the live skills system. Asking "can you do math?" or "can you render HTML?" now returns "yes" with the right context instead of an apologetic "no".
- **Planner: weekly schedules fired daily.** The day-of-week selection in the Planner modal defaulted to Mon to Fri, which made any "weekly" schedule fire on every weekday. Defaults now reset to a single day when the user switches to weekly, and `isTaskDue` validates day arrays defensively (coerces strings to numbers, rejects malformed entries) so the day filter actually applies.
- **Planner: BYDAY preferences ignored.** Same root cause as above. With the default reset and defensive coercion in place, picking "Monday + Wednesday" now fires only on Monday and Wednesday.
- **Planner: tasks not visible in Tasks list.** Recurring tasks created in the Planner now appear in the global Tasks page alongside one-off tasks. Each Planner run still produces its own execution entry with full logs.
- **Telegram proactive Friend Mode messages not firing since the Desktop Buddy proactive feature was added.** When the shared `resolveOutboundChatId` helper was introduced (which falls back to `telegram-state.json` when the in-memory `pairedChatId` is stale, e.g. after a Telegram bot restart), three proactive senders migrated to it (calendar reminders, autopilot morning briefing, buddy intelligence) but four sites in the autonomous runner were missed: Friend Mode check-ins, the autopilot approval notifier, the daily standup delivery, and cron-task completion notifications. From the user's perspective: Buddy proactive kept working through bot restarts via the fallback while Friend Mode silently died. All four sites now resolve the outbound chat ID through the same helper, so Buddy and Telegram fire in parallel as intended with their own cooldowns and conditions.
- **MCP Servers tab failing to load with 401 error.** UI status display now loads correctly while CLI auth boundary stays intact.



## v10.2.5


### Bug Fixes (Critical)

- **Skills system.** Fixed 29 broken reads in the orchestrator that caused all skill toggles to be silently ignored since the skills feature shipped. Computer Use Tools, Calendar Reminders, and other skills now actually function when toggled. 
- **UI Skill Toggles.** Toggles persist across restart. Previously, toggles appeared to switch on but reverted after reload due to camelCase / snake_case key drift. Silent backend errors now trigger UI rollback instead of being ignored. - **Playground Override Persistence.** "Use active model" for per-mode overrides no longer springs back to the previous selection after Save. Root cause was Next.js Server Action serialization stripping `undefined` values. - **MCP State Reporting.** The model reports MCP server status correctly instead of always claiming "off". - **MCP Backend `listServersForCli`.** Returns real per-server status (disabled / connected / stopped / error) instead of hardcoded "connected" with 0 tools. - **Calendar Reminders Endpoint.** Was permanently skipped due to the broken `settings.skills` field. Now reads from skills.json correctly. - **Proxy Dispatcher.** All 12 provider sites use undiciFetch for proxy-aware HTTP. Runtime ECONNREFUSED errors with proxy enabled are gone. - **Token Cap Cloudflare / NVIDIA.** 32K → real 128K. 
### Features

- **KaTeX Math Rendering.** Inline `$E=mc^2$` and block `$$...$$` render as actual mathematics. - **Edit / Branch / Delete on User Messages.** Hover actions on user bubbles. Edit triggers truncate-and-resend. Branch creates a new chat from that point. Delete removes the message and all subsequent responses. - **Manual Compact Button.** Compress chat history on demand instead of waiting for the 75% auto-threshold. - **Token Split Tooltip.** Hover the token badge to see "X.XK input / Y.YK output". Default display unchanged. - **Code Block Copy.** Hover any code block to reveal a Copy button. 2-second "Copied!" feedback. - **Code Block Ctrl+A Scoping.** Ctrl/Cmd+A inside a code block selects only that block, not the whole window. Works for Markdown code blocks AND HTML preview blocks. - **HTML Preview Copy.** Copy button added to the HTML preview header alongside Download HTML. - **Identity Maintenance Toggle.** Moved to its dedicated section in Settings (was buried under Agent & Tasks). 
### Stability / Polish

- **Header Responsive Layout.** Buttons collapse to icon-only below 1280px viewport with native tooltips on hover. Header no longer breaks on tablet portrait or narrow desktop. - **Provider Switcher Dropdown.** Anchors correctly in chat AND playground. No more left-side cutoff. - **Compact Button hidden in Mini Mode.** Mini Mode stays minimal. - **Compaction Few-Shot Memory.** Last 6 tool calls preserved as few-shot examples after auto-compact. - **MCPClient Error Sink.** Default error event handler prevents Node crashes when MCP servers misbehave. - **Token Display Tooltip.** Power users see input / output split, casual users see unchanged total. 

## v10.2.2

### Provider layer

- **Live model fetch for cloud providers.** Each provider card in Settings → AI Providers now has a Refresh button. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, xAI, Together, MiniMax, Cloudflare, NVIDIA, SambaNova, and Cerebras all expose `/v1/models` (or the equivalent vendor-specific endpoint). Clicking refresh stores the live list in `settings.modelCache[provider]`. Model dropdowns prefer the cached list when present and fall back to the built-in baseline. New models become usable without a Skales release.
- **User-configurable model limits.** New collapsible "Override Model Limits" section under AI Providers. Add per-(provider, model) override rows for context and output token caps. Use `*` as the model name to apply the limit to all models of that provider that don't have an explicit override. Useful for newly released models whose limits differ from the built-in registry. Resolves ahead of the static registry in `lib/model-limits.ts` via a 5s in-process cache of `settings.modelLimits`.
- **Per-provider proxy now actually routes.** v10.2.0 declared the feature but the dispatcher was not reaching the fetch calls — the standalone Next.js build did not include the undici package, so the runtime require returned undefined silently. Fixed by making undici an explicit dependency, switching to a proper import, and externalizing it in the Next.js webpack config.

### Chat

- **Manual message delete persists across reload and restart.** v10.2.0 trimmed the in-memory message array but did not propagate the deletion to disk. The delete handler now explicitly saves the trimmed session.
- **Branch action creates the correct slice.** v10.2.0 surfaced the Branch hover button on chat bubbles but the slice index was wrong — the new session contained a different subset than the user expected. Fixed end-to-end: clicking Branch on the Nth message creates a new session with messages 1 through N inclusive.
- **Bubble action labels and toasts are translated.** A handful of `chat.bubble.*` locale keys shipped without translations in v10.2.0 — the Branch toast and the Delete confirmation showed raw key strings. Real translations added across all 12 locales.

### Settings

- **Per-Mode Model Override UI uses real provider data.** The dropdowns previously showed a hardcoded curated list regardless of what the user had configured. Now mirrors the chat header picker: provider list shows only enabled providers with API keys, model list reflects the user's configured plus live-fetched models for the chosen provider.
- **Playground on-page picker and Settings Per-Mode Override share the same source of truth.** Both write to `settings.modeOverrides.playground` and re-hydrate from disk on every settings-change event.
- **The "?" agents-info trigger no longer appears on the Settings page.** It belongs on the Agents page only — which is unchanged.

### UI

- **Chat and Playground header model pickers hide on small viewports.** Below 768px the picker is hidden entirely, matching the existing Mini Mode behavior.

### Notes

- 
-  
- Schema additions (`modelCache`, `modelLimits` on top of v10.2.0's existing additions) are all OPTIONAL with safe defaults. Existing `settings.json` files load unchanged.
- 12-locale parity preserved.


## v10.2.0

Iterative quality release across providers, modes, error UX, and chat history. No new product surfaces; existing surfaces become more resilient and configurable. Auto-updater pipeline unchanged.  

### Provider layer

- **Per-(provider, model) limits registry.** Context window and max output tokens are now read from a per-provider, per-model registry (`lib/model-limits.ts`). Replaces the previous hardcoded ceilings (32K context fallback, 2048-4096 output) across orchestrator, chat, autopilot, code-builder, browser-control, autonomous-runner. Models that the registry doesn't know about fall through to per-provider defaults, then to a conservative absolute fallback. Live HF Router context_length values can override the static entry at call time.
- **Smart context compaction with LLM summary.** When effective context exceeds 75% of budget, older turns are summarized via a single low-cost LLM call (`noTools: true`, 600 tokens) instead of being truncated to 280 characters per message. Falls back to the truncation behaviour if the summary call fails. Compaction is now reached by the orchestrator: upstream `slice(-40)` and `slice(-20)` history caps in chat.ts and chat/page.tsx are replaced with a byte-budgeted slice (default 8MB / 4MB / 1MB / 512KB depending on entry path).
- **Provider error translation.** New `lib/error-translator.ts` converts raw 5xx/4xx response bodies into actionable user messages. Pattern rules cover Ollama (`llama runner has terminated`, `cuda out of memory`, missing models, unreachable host), OpenRouter (rate limits, missing credit), Anthropic (context exceeded, auth failed), OpenAI (context exceeded, quota). Each translation carries a `toastAction` (continue / retry / compact / switch-fallback / open-settings) consumed by chat error toasts. Generic fallback annotates with provider+status for debug logs.
- **Per-provider proxy support.** Provider configs accept an optional `proxy: { enabled, url }` field. When set, requests to that provider go through an Undici `ProxyAgent` dispatcher. Cached per URL. Wired into chat.ts (OpenAI-compatible / Anthropic / Google) and orchestrator.ts (agentDecide hot paths). Schema change is additive — existing settings.json files load unchanged.
- **Multiple custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.** New `customProviders[]` array in settings supports more than one custom endpoint at a time. Legacy `providers.custom` continues to work and is mirrored as `customProviders[0]` via a one-shot migration. Settings UI exposes label, base URL, API key, model, enabled toggle, tool-calling and vision toggles per entry.

### Modes

- **Per-mode model resolution contract.** New `lib/mode-routing.ts` resolves which (provider, model) each Skales mode uses: explicit caller override → `settings.modeOverrides[mode]` → `settings.activeProvider/model`. Wired into Playground (askAI + generate), Buddy chat, and exposed in Settings as a "Per-Mode Model Overrides" panel covering Chat, Codework, Organization, Studio, Playground, Buddy, Spotlight.
- **Playground respects active model.** The previous silent override to Anthropic Sonnet 4.5 is now an opt-in setting (`playgroundQualityBoost`, default OFF). When OFF, Playground uses the active provider/model or the per-mode override. Toggle and per-conversation provider/model picker now live on the Playground page header.
- **Inline model picker in Chat.** Compact icon-only button in the chat header opens an absolute overlay popup listing installed providers and curated models. Layout never shifts. Solid background respects the active light/dark theme. Custom agent provider/model wins over the global default in the "Use agent default" row. Picker is removed entirely in Mini Mode.
- **Chat command `/model <id>` persists.** The slash command now writes the new model to `providers[activeProvider].model` via `saveAllSettings`, refreshes the local settings state, and surfaces a clear error bubble on save failure. Cached invalid model IDs no longer survive `/model` switches.

### Tools and routing

- **Calendar routing disambiguation.** `create_calendar_event` description anchors against natural-language calendar phrasing ("in Google Cal", "in den Kalender", "gcal", "schedule a meeting at TIME"). `planner_create_task` description clarifies it is for autonomous Skales prompts, not human appointments. TASK ROUTING RULES block in the orchestrator system prompt gains a Calendar branch above the Planner branch. Internal Planner is unchanged in scope.
- **Tavily gate respects user toggle.** When the Tavily skill is disabled or no Tavily API key is configured, `search_web` is filtered out of the tool manifest before it reaches the LLM. Other web tools (`fetch_web_page`, `extract_web_text`) remain enabled.
- **Tool prune for low-TPM providers.** `shouldPruneTools` auto-fires for providers with TPM ceilings under 15K (Groq 12K), pruning the 136-entry tool manifest from the request even when the user message is non-trivial. Prevents 413 "request too large" errors on free tiers.

### Autopilot

- **Master Switch persists from the Autopilot page.** Toggling the master switch from the Autopilot page (not just Settings) now persists `isAutonomousMode` atomically alongside heartbeat start/stop. Activate-on-Start works from a clean restart regardless of which UI surface the toggle came from.
- **Friend Mode observability and persistent cooldown.** Every early-return point in `tickFriendMode` emits a structured `console.warn('[friend-mode] skip', { reason, ... })`. Tick start logs the active behavior. The in-memory `friendModeLastSentAt` Map is hydrated from settings on first tick and persisted after each successful send so app restarts no longer reset cooldown.
- **Identity maintenance auto-approve.** Optional Settings toggle. When enabled, the 3 AM identity maintenance job bypasses the safe-mode and critical-action approval gates. Logged to the audit trail. Default OFF.

### Chat UX

- **Manual delete and branch from any message.** Hover actions on user and assistant message bubbles. Delete trims trailing tool messages so no orphan tool results remain. Branch creates a new session populated with messages up to the chosen point.
- **Resume action on error toasts.** Provider error toasts now carry an action button keyed by the error type: continue / retry on Ollama crashes and timeouts, compact on context-exceeded errors, switch-fallback on rate limits and quota errors, open-settings on auth failures. Wired into orchestrator errors, vision flow errors, and approval-result errors.
- **Continuation on output truncation.** When a model returns `finish_reason: 'length'` with no further tool calls, the orchestrator injects "Continue from where you left off." and re-enters the ReAct loop instead of dropping the partial answer.

### Settings UX

- **3-fallback UI cap removed.** The Fallback Chain section accepts as many entries as the schema does. Comment in `actions/chat.ts` updated.
- **Per-Mode Model Overrides panel.** New section under AI Providers. Per mode: "Use active model" toggle plus provider+model dropdowns when the override is on. Empty entries are not persisted.
- **Additional Custom Providers panel.** New section under Advanced. Each entry is a card with label, base URL, API key, model, enabled, tool-calling, vision toggles. Add and remove buttons. Legacy single-slot Custom Provider UI continues to work.
- **Identity Maintenance Auto-approve toggle.** Lives under Autopilot in v10.2.0. Will move under Settings → Memory near the existing identity maintenance controls in a follow-up.

### Discover

- **Layout fixes for long-form posts.** Post text wraps on long URLs (`break-words` + `overflow-wrap: anywhere`). Category badges truncate at 140px. Header row wraps when content is wide. Skales Insider posts no longer break the feed layout.

### Telegram

- **Approval flow shows continuation hint.** After a Telegram-approved tool runs, the result message ends with "🔄 Tap or send Continue to resume." so the user knows the agent flow is paused, not finished. Optional `telegramApprovalAutoResume` setting (default OFF) lets the agent re-enter the ReAct loop automatically; on by user choice only, since it carries the historical risk of v7.2.1 infinite-loop regression.

### Updater notifications

- **Changelog field carries through IPC.** `electron/updater.js` now emits both `releaseNotes` (legacy) and `changelog` (new) on the IPC payload for `update-available` and `update-downloaded`. Renderer reads either. Update page renders the changelog whether the trigger came from server-side check or auto-detect IPC.

### Localization

- 11 new `system.errors.*` keys for the provider error translator, plus 3 new `chat.modelPicker.*` keys for the inline picker, with real translations across all 12 locales (de, en, es, fr, hr, ja, ko, pt, ru, tr, vi, zh). .


### Notes

-  
-  
- Settings schema additions (`customProviders`, `modeOverrides`, `playgroundQualityBoost`, `identityMaintenanceAutoApprove`, `telegramApprovalAutoResume`, `proxy` per provider) are all OPTIONAL with safe defaults. Existing settings.json files load unchanged.
-

## v10.1.1 - Hotfix

Five hotfix items rolled up on top of v10.1.0 Design. No new features, no architecture changes.


### Vision routing

- **Vision-capable model detection extended.** Gemma 3 (4B / 12B / 27B), Gemma 4 (E2B / E4B / 26B / 31B), LLaVA (7B / 13B / 34B / llama3 / phi3), Pixtral (12B / large), Qwen-VL / Qwen2-VL / Qwen2.5-VL, and MiniCPM-V are now recognised. Image inputs route to the configured vision model correctly.
- **Explicit user override is respected.** If the user has set a Vision Model in Settings, it is used regardless of whether auto-detection knows about it. Auto-detection becomes a fallback, not a gate.
- **Tool-call hardening.** Malformed tool-call JSON is parsed forgivingly (extracts the first valid JSON block from prose). On total failure, one explicit retry asks the model to return valid tool-call format. Tool execution errors are surfaced into the next LLM turn so the model cannot silently report success on a failed write or denied permission.

### Chat history

- **Mobile-origin badge.** Messages synced from Skales Mobile now show a small phone icon next to the timestamp. Tooltip reads "Sent from Skales Mobile". Read-only visual cue, no behavioural change.

### Autopilot

- **Activation modes.** Settings on the Autopilot page now include an Activation Mode picker with three options: Manual (legacy default - last toggle persists), On Startup (heartbeat starts automatically when Skales launches if the master switch is on), and Time Window (heartbeat is active during a user-defined daily 24-hour window such as 09:00 - 17:00). Time windows that cross midnight are supported (e.g. 22:00 - 06:00). Manual toggles inside an active window are respected for the rest of that window so a user can pause without fighting the auto-activation. Existing v10.1.0 users default to Manual and see no behaviour change unless they explicitly switch modes.


### Notes

- 
-  

---

## v10.1.0 "Design" 

The biggest creative update yet. Skales Studio gets a Design Tab that turns prompts into real HTML/CSS designs. Codework matures into a full autonomous coding agent. HF Spaces and MCP servers now work everywhere. Smoother animations across the app.

### Studio

- **Studio Design Tab** is the new first tab in Studio. Type a prompt, pick a template (Landing Page, Dashboard, Mobile Screen, Pricing, Hero, Login, Settings), get production-ready HTML + CSS + Tailwind back. Live preview iframe, palette extraction, font extraction, fullscreen preview mode (Escape to exit), inline refine drawer, recent designs dropdown. Designs persist between sessions (50 designs FIFO).
- **Studio Image Generation revival.** HuggingFace image provider now routes through the Inference Providers Router (`router.huggingface.co`) with two-attempt fallback chain. The legacy 404 issue is fixed for SDXL, FLUX, and other models. Clear error messages on failure with provider-fallback suggestions.
- **HTML extraction made robust** against five common LLM output variants (fenced, unfenced, with or without DOCTYPE, truncated). Smaller models that don't follow exact output format still produce usable designs.
- **View Transitions API** for smooth tab crossfades in Studio (Chrome, Edge, Safari TP). Graceful fallback on Firefox.

### Codework

Codework matured significantly across the v10.0.4 to v10.1.0 cycle. It is now a full autonomous coding agent, not just a chat with file tools.

- **Approval Gates.** Three new toggles: auto-approve writes, auto-approve exec, auto-approve all. Pending-approval map with `/api/codework/approve` endpoint. Conservative defaults (Review mode) for first-time users.
- **Forbidden command denylist** expanded from 5 to 17 patterns plus 8 dangerous pipe-pairs. Common destructive operations (`rm -rf $HOME`, fork bombs, dd to disk, etc.) blocked at orchestrator level even with auto-approve enabled.
- **Test loop with progress guardrail.** New `testCommand` field per session lets Codework run tests after each code change. After 3 consecutive test failures with no progress, the loop aborts and Codework reports back instead of grinding tokens.
- **Preview Mode** for write operations. Write tools generate diffs that surface to the user for accept/reject before applying. New SSE events `tool_pending_write`, `tool_write_accepted`, `tool_write_rejected`.
- **MCP tool consumption.** Connected MCP servers are now exposed as tools to Codework. Tool naming `mcp_<server>_<tool>`. Conservative auto-approval gating.
- **Repository-map indexing.** Codework now builds a project-wide map (functions, classes, exports per file) cached in `.skales-backup/repo-map.json` with SHA-256 Merkle root for fast invalidation. Scales to 500+ files. Regex-based parser (tree-sitter AST upgrade coming in v10.2).
- **Long-context tiers.** For huge projects, Codework adapts: full tree+keyfiles+repomap under 50 files, tree+repomap up to 500, directory-only+repomap above 500.
- **Token usage tracking.** Live token counter shown in Codework with indigo pill, updates per LLM call via new `usage` SSE event.
- **Commit-message generator.** New helper drafts commit messages from staged changes following Conventional Commits style.

### Cross-tool integration

- **HF Spaces and MCP everywhere.** Activated HF Spaces and connected MCP servers are now usable from Chat, Codework, AND Studio. Add a Space once, use it anywhere.
- **Active Tools Across Skales** panel in Settings shows which tools are available in which surfaces (Chat / Codework / Studio).
- **Studio HF Spaces invocation endpoint** (`/api/studio/space-invoke`) lets Studio invoke any active Space directly.

### Lio AI

- **Recursive project snapshot.** Lio AI now builds a complete file map of your project on each plan/build cycle (max depth 10, max 2000 files). Better context awareness for multi-file changes.
- **Plan context** assembled from project structure + chat history for higher-quality plans.

### Chat

- **Token-pruning heuristic** for short queries widened to 120 characters (was 80). Queries like "Explain X with examples" keep their tools instead of being stripped to plain chat.
- **gpt-tokenizer integration.** Exact token counting for context-budget calculations across providers (Groq 12k, Mistral 30k, Cerebras 32k, SambaNova 16k). Tools are pruned only when they actually exceed provider TPM ceilings.
- **Smoother streaming token rendering** via batched requestAnimationFrame updates.
- **Update toast localized** in all 12 locales with version interpolation. Update detail page renders the actual changelog from `latest.json`.

### Stability

- **JSON I/O hardened.** All JSON reads/writes across 65+ files migrated to `readJsonSafe`/`writeJsonSafe` helpers. Handles malformed JSON, missing files, BOM characters, partial writes.
- **Hierarchy clarity in Organizations.** Orchestrator override fix for the Person/Agents/Organization confusion that affected multi-agent setups.
- **Namesake trope removed** from all 12 locales (was a phrase pattern that drifted across localizations).
- **Codework session sidebar** active-state correctly handles trailing slashes (no more two-row highlights).
- **createSession testCommand wiring** fixed: the field now persists correctly into session metadata.
- **Delete session prompt** now properly localized in all 12 languages.


### Mobile

- **Outbox foreground sync** via AppState listener. Pending messages flip to "failed" immediately when app resumes (was up to 10 seconds of background drift before).
- **Periodic 10-second sweep** keeps outbox state fresh during active chat use.

### Landing

- **Migration sources** in v902 Canvas Office blog and Migration Importer feature now mention OpenClaw, Hermes, and Cherry Studio alongside ChatGPT/Claude/Copilot/Gemini.
- **Three new feature blocks**: ComfyUI (local image generation), HF Inference Providers (200+ models), DeepSeek V4 (1M context, agent-tuned).

### Note on Lio AI export from Studio

The "Open in Lio AI" export from the Studio Design Tab was investigated and removed during the V102 dev cycle. Lio AI's `/code` page does not currently consume `?project=<id>` URL params, and Lio AI is fundamentally a different workflow (architect-reviewer-build loop) than Studio Design's static HTML iteration. Lio AI is left 100% untouched. Use the Download HTML button instead.


## v10.0.4 — April 20, 2026

### Telegram Integration
- **Fixed**: Safe Mode approval flow broken since v9.x. Tool approvals from Telegram now correctly trigger the approval prompt and execute on your "yes" response (GitHub #77)
- **Fixed**: Telegram bot no longer requires opening the chat page after app launch to come online. Bot spawns automatically 3 seconds after server ready (GitHub #78)

### Provider Presets
- **Added**: Minimax, Cloudflare Workers AI, and Nvidia NIM as first-class provider presets with pre-filled endpoints. No more manual Custom OpenAI-Compatible configuration needed for these (GitHub #76)
- **Added**: "Show only active" toggle in the Providers list to hide unused providers

### Chat & UX
- **Added**: Response time display on assistant messages — see how long each response took (GitHub #61)
- **Added**: Global hotkey `Cmd+Shift+H` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+H` (Windows/Linux) to toggle Desktop Buddy visibility. Handy for fullscreen video (GitHub #60)
- **Improved**: Settings search now covers more sections, handles accents (é matches e, ä matches a), and has better keyword coverage in German/Spanish/French/Russian (GitHub #59)
- **Improved**: Fallback provider banner reworded for clarity with a details modal explaining why the fallback activated and how to fix the primary (GitHub #70)

### Export & Remote Access
- **Fixed**: Export via Tailscale or remote browser access no longer returns a corrupted HTML file instead of a ZIP. Content-Type headers, MIME validation, and error handling properly hardened across the HTTP route
- **Unchanged**: Native Electron Export remains the same, ~13MB ZIP with manifest and `.skales-data/` — no regression

### Email
- **Improved**: Outlook/Gmail/Yahoo IMAP authentication errors now explain the App-Specific Password / OAuth2 requirement (Microsoft disabled Basic Auth in 2022) instead of showing a generic "auth failed" message

### Build & Infrastructure
- **Fixed**: `build-info.json` now correctly reports the current version. `scripts/build-id.js` is now invoked as the first step in `scripts/release-build.sh` on every release (GitHub #79)

### Locales
- All 12 locales (en, de, es, fr, hr, ja, ko, pt, ru, tr, vi, zh) updated with v10.0.4 strings — informal register maintained

---

## v10.0.3 — Stability (April 18, 2026)

### Bug Fixes
- **Bonjour/mDNS Collision** — instance name now includes PID (`Skales-<hostname>-<pid>`); multiple Skales instances on the same machine no longer shadow each other in swarm discovery
- **Multi-Agent Dispatch Toast** — completion notification was silently dropped after all subtasks finished; now fires a purple 🦁 toast with job title + subtask count (7 s display duration)
- **Update Page i18n** — "Later" button showed raw key `update.later` instead of translated text; `later` key added to all 12 locale files
- **Ollama Small-Model Warning** — settings panel now shows an orange warning when a known small model (≤3B params) is selected with `Max tools > 0`, advising the user to reduce tools or switch to a larger model
- **fal.ai Studio Hang** — video generation polled a manually constructed status URL that broke when fal.ai changed their queue URL structure; client now uses `status_url` / `response_url` from the submit response with fallback to constructed URLs
- **Codework UI Lag** — blank activity panel during 1–2 s SSE startup gap replaced with an optimistic "Starting session…" phase entry so the UI never appears frozen

---

## v10.0.2 — 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **Tool Filter Regression (critical).** Disabled the context-aware tool filter introduced in v9.2.1 which was silently dropping core tools (`send_telegram_message`, `write_file`, `create_directory`, and others) based on keyword matching. This was the root cause of the widespread "Unknown tool" errors users reported after v10.0.0. All tools are now available in every conversation until a safer allow-list approach lands in v10.1.
- **Export Dialog "Source path not allowed".** The `copy-file` IPC handler now accepts `os.tmpdir()` as a valid source path. In v10.0.1 the export bundle ZIP was written to the OS temp directory, but the handler's whitelist only permitted `DATA_DIR`, so exports failed silently.
- **Multi-Step Exit Guard.** The ReAct loop now only exits when the model returns zero tool calls. Previously, response text emitted alongside tool calls (e.g. "let me continue with...") was incorrectly interpreted as an exit signal, breaking legitimate multi-step tasks.

### Improved

- **`SAME_TOOL_NAME_HARD_CAP` raised 3 → 15.** The per-turn cap on how often a single tool name can be called was too low to support normal bulk operations (creating 5+ folders, writing 10 files). Infinite loops with identical arguments are still caught by stall detection (2 identical calls) and the dedup tracker (2 identical args), so this only affects legitimate bulk work.
- **Progress-Speak Auto-Continue.** When a model made tool calls in previous iterations but then stops with short progress-style text ("let me continue", "jetzt erstelle ich die restlichen", "remaining", etc.), the orchestrator now automatically re-prompts it to finish via tool calls instead of exiting the loop. Mitigates Sonnet 3.7's mid-task pause behavior on bulk operations.

### Known Issues

- Sonnet 3.7 may still pause on 5+ item bulk tasks despite auto-continue. Use Claude Opus 4, Sonnet 4, or Minimax for guaranteed single-shot bulk execution.
- Minimax models may emit tool calls as JSON text in chat instead of real function calls for some prompts.
- Codework UI may appear frozen for 1–2 seconds before streaming catches up; backend is working.
- Multi-Agent Dispatch toast notification is not currently firing; check the Tasks tab for progress.

---

## v10.0.1 — Hotfix (April 17, 2026)

### Critical Fixes
- **Auto-Updater Schema Mismatch** resolved — flat and nested feed schemas now both accepted; zero successful auto-updates from v10.0.0 was caused by this. Users on v9.x must install v10.0.1 manually once.
- **Export/Import** — valid zips with schema version, manifest, credential redaction; accepts legacy formats for backward compat
- **Multi-Step Tool Chains** — no longer exit prematurely when the model returns empty text between tool calls
- **Advisor Strategy** — simple chat no longer routed through the expensive Planner (complexity gate)
- **Gemini Tool Schema** — stripped OpenAI-specific fields that Gemini silently rejected; tool calls restored for Gemini models
- **create_task vs planner_create_task** — disambiguated via explicit tool descriptions + system prompt routing rules

### Integrations
- Telegram outbound Chat-ID persisted across bot restarts (`telegram-state.json`)
- SMTP Test race condition eliminated
- Lio AI provider dropdown labels no longer show raw i18n key paths
- Custom endpoint URLs (LM Studio, Ollama) normalized case-insensitive at fetch time

### Agent Behavior
- System prompt now explicitly authorizes file access (prevents "Systembeschränkungen" hallucinations)
- Folder structure creation supports recursive paths in a single tool call
- Internal diagnostics protocol — agent checks local state before suggesting support

### Configuration
- New Setting: Request timeout (30–600s slider) for long agent tasks
- Emoji loader negative-cache — no more 404 spam on codepoints without Lottie

### Discover Feed
- 29 v10 event templates now render custom text from client payloads

### Security (PHP + WordPress)
- Feed backend: IP hashing aligned with SHA-256 + salt across all endpoints
- WordPress Connector 1.2.1: timing-safe token compare + file upload MIME allowlist

### Localization
- 132 new `settings.providers.*` keys across 12 locales
- 4 chat state messages moved from hardcoded English to i18n
- requestTimeout setting fully translated

### Known Issues
- Reasoning display still abbreviated (deferred to v10.1)
- macOS notarization not yet implemented — right-click → Open required on first launch
- SSH key authentication in SSH tool deferred to v10.1

### Upgrade Path
Auto-update works from v10.0.1 onwards. Users on v9.x: download manually from skales.app once.

---

## v10.0.0 — "Closing the Gap" (April 16, 2026)

The biggest Skales release ever. Desktop + Mobile + Relay now form one ecosystem: every message you send from your phone routes through Desktop's full tool set, every capability you build on Desktop is reachable from the Mobile companion. Chat feels smoother. Studio speaks video. Settings speaks voice.

### Skales Mobile (NEW)
- Official Skales Mobile app for Android (iOS coming) — submitted to Play Store (beta, closed testing)
- Full standalone AI agent in your pocket — 27 mobile tools, works with or without the desktop running
- Remote Mode: pair via QR over the end-to-end encrypted relay (wss://relay.skales.app, TweetNaCl box, keys never leave the devices)
- Paired phones get full access to THIS desktop's agentDecide pipeline — all 139+ tools (shell, files, browser control, email, calendar, Studio, etc.)
- Image upload from mobile now forwards through the bridge as OpenAI-vision multimodal content (Desktop Vision-capable providers analyze it like a local upload)
- Shared ecosystem: same Discover Feed, same Custom Agents, same Skills

### Studio — LTX-2.3 Video Generation (NEW provider)
- fal.ai LTX-2.3 integration (text-to-video + image-to-video, standard and fast variants)
- $0.06/sec at 1080p, native 9:16 portrait support, 5s and 10s durations
- Added alongside existing Veo/Kling/Runway/Replicate providers — shares the same Cloud-Render pipeline
- Live "Connected" badge in Studio when fal API key is configured in Settings
- 4 new localized model labels (`studio.falModels.textToVideo`, `imageToVideo`, `textToVideoFast`, `imageToVideoFast`) across all 12 languages

### Animated Emoji System (NEW)
- Noto Color Emoji font bundled — all Unicode emojis now render identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- 16 brand and expressive emojis with smooth Lottie animations served from Skales CDN
- Animated splash screen — Gecko mascot animates during app startup
- Dashboard wave — hover over the greeting hand for a welcome animation
- Discover Feed spark picker — emoji reactions animate on hover, play once in the sent confirmation
- Chat expressiveness — AI messages with creative, memory, video, or web context emojis animate on arrival
- Big emoji messages — send 1-3 emojis alone and they render larger with animation (iOS/Telegram style)
- Easter egg shortcuts in chat: `:gecko:`, `:bubbles:`, `:paw:`, `/highfive`, `/bow`
- Emoji privacy controls — optional Google CDN fallback in Settings → Privacy (off by default, GDPR compliant)
- Emoji preloading — brand emojis cached on app start for instant rendering

### Voice — TTS + STT
- OpenAI TTS provider added (voices: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer) — reuses the existing OpenAI provider key, no extra setup
- New "Read responses aloud" toggle in Settings → TTS — when enabled, every assistant reply is spoken via the configured provider once streaming completes
- Smart markdown stripping before TTS so the voice doesn't read ``` or # out loud
- Per-message speaker button on every assistant bubble — click to listen, click again to stop, visible on hover next to Copy
- Groq-key hint in the STT section (free Whisper access) with one-click jump to AI Providers tab
- All voice UI fully localized (readAloud, stopReading, autoReadLabel, autoReadHint, etc. in 12 languages)

### Chat — Smoothness & Inline Preview
- Message entrance via Framer Motion spring (stiffness 320, damping 30, mass 0.9)
- AnimatePresence with initial=false — session restores stay instant, only NEW messages fade-lift in
- Typing indicator rewritten from translate-bounce to smooth wave (scale + opacity, 1.2s loop, 160ms stagger)
- Typing bubble itself now fades in instead of popping, same style preserved when the agent transitions to tool-status so the indicator never "jumps"
- Scroll-to-bottom FAB: lime-circle appears bottom-right when user scrolls up ≥200px from latest; click returns to live view + re-enables auto-follow
- Inline HTML Preview: ```` ```html ```` fenced code blocks now render a sandboxed live iframe with Show Code / Download HTML / Save as Image / Mute / Hide toggles
- Global mute + hide persist across all chats and sessions via localStorage — "34 webviews, 0 audio" on a single click
- Save as Image — pixel-exact region capture, works on sandboxed iframes
- Global `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS guard — OS-level accessibility setting disables all animations across the app

### Capabilities & System Prompt
- APP_VERSION bumped to 10.0.0, APP_VERSION_NAME = "Closing the Gap"
- System prompt (Level 0 + Level 1) now explicitly knows about Mobile pairing, Inline HTML Preview, the fal.ai video path, Remote API, and the 12 supported languages
- Agent is proactive: when the user describes something visual (chart, card, map, SVG, mini-app), it offers inline preview in the user's language before producing it
- capabilities.json emits a live `mobile` block per rebuild (pairedDeviceCount, relay URL, E2E method, paired-device summary)
- 6-theme mention (Dark / Light / Midnight / Forest / Amber / Glass) added to prompt

### Bug Fixes
- Buddy window draggable on Windows via native mousedown cursor tracking (screen.getCursorScreenPoint delta → setPosition), plus Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+B global reset shortcut
- Agent delete button fixed — sandboxed Electron renderer silently drops window.confirm(); replaced with a two-click armed-state confirmation directly in the button
- Playwright chromium detection now sorts descending and matches both `chromium-NNNN` and `chromium_headless_shell-NNNN` layouts — always picks the newest version installed
- Telegram bot auto-restart watchdog: child.on('exit') listener with rate-limit (max 3 respawns per rolling hour), 5s backoff, respects current config enable/disable
- feed.php `update_profile` now also updates the `tag` field in-place when a new gamertag is requested and not taken by another user — no more duplicate JSONL entries
- Next.js proxy forwards the new tag in the update_profile JSON body so feed.php can rename in place
- `settings.stt.help` i18n key re-applied (was hardcoded back to raw text)
- Hardcoded "(API key required)" badge in Studio video-provider dropdown moved to `studio.apiKeyRequired` i18n key (12 languages)
- `build-info.json` bumped from 9.3.0 → 10.0.0 so boot log matches package.json
- External links in browser view now open in the default OS browser
- Share window overlay responds to Escape key across chat, spotlight, and buddy
- Browser scroll-to-bottom works reliably on lazy-loading and single-page applications
- Playbook steps now wait for actual page load before proceeding
- macOS screen recording permission detected with user-facing guidance in share window



### Localization
- ~60 new i18n keys added across 12 languages (en, de, es, fr, hr, ja, ko, pt, ru, tr, vi, zh) for fal.ai models, HTML preview, voice, Mobile, animated emojis, mute/unmute, scroll-to-latest
- All new German keys are Du/Sie-neutral (Infinitiv + Substantiv form — "Vorlesen", "Stumm", "Als Bild speichern")
- ALL new user-facing text goes through the i18n system — zero hardcoded English in new code


## v9.3.0 — Stability Release (April 13, 2026)

### Stability

- Tool-awareness warning for local models with tools disabled



## v9.2.3 — File Operations & Stability (April 2026)

### Critical Fixes
- **File tool routing**: Unified create_folder/create_directory, added tilde expansion to ALL file tool handlers
- **Model routing**: System prompt now explicitly instructs which tool to use for each file operation
- **Multi-step tasks**: Agent no longer stops after first tool call — continuation prompt added for incomplete directory+file creation
- **Sidebar version**: Now shows correct version number (was stuck on 9.2.1)
- **Slash commands**: All 24 commands audited; /tools list updated to reflect unified tool names

### Improvements
- Duplicate tools merged (create_folder → create_directory, list_files → list_directory) — old names kept as aliases for backward compat
- Duplicate tool definitions removed from model payload — models now see one tool per operation
- create_document handler now expands tilde paths before resolving
- /tools slash command updated with correct tool names and added missing tools (search_web, download_file, check_system_status)

### Verified (no changes needed)

- Playwright install: PATH resolution, chromium-only install, error handling all solid


## v9.2.2 — Hotfix (April 2026)

### Critical Fixes
- **HOSTNAME**: Always bind to 0.0.0.0 — Tailscale, LAN, and remote access restored
- **Auto-Updater**: Full download with progress bar, SHA-512 verification, install and restart UI. No more "Download at skales.app" link.
- **Playwright install**: Fixed PATH inheritance for Install buttons in Settings > Advanced (brew/npx not found in Electron)
- **Custom Endpoint status**: "Not connected" no longer shown for working local endpoints (LM Studio, KoboldCpp)

### Improvements
- Discover Feed admin delete button (for moderators)
- Playwright detection now also checks ~/.skales-data/playwright

---

## v9.2.1 — Stability & Completeness (April 2026)

### Ollama / Local Models
- **Tools disabled by default for local models**: Ollama, LM Studio, KoboldCpp, vLLM no longer receive tool definitions. Eliminates timeouts on consumer hardware.
- **Tool slider**: New "Max tools for local models" slider (0–70, step 5, default 15). Shared across all local providers.
- **Fast-fail retry**: If a local model doesn't respond within 10s with tools, Skales retries without tools automatically.
- **Timeout leak fix**: `customEndpointTimeout` (30s) was overriding Ollama's 180s timeout for all providers. Now scoped to custom endpoints only.
- **Chat hard-kill extended**: Local providers get 200s instead of 60s before the chat page kills the request.
- **`isLocalProvider()` helper**: Detects Ollama, LM Studio, KoboldCpp, vLLM, and any localhost/127.0.0.1 endpoint. Used across tool stripping, timeouts, and retry logic.

### Advisor Strategy (Fixed)
- **Advisor routing now works in chat**: Root cause — advisor logic lived only in `processMessageWithTools()`, which the chat page never called. Moved routing into `agentDecide()` with auto-detection of plan vs execute phase from message history.
- **Custom model text field fix**: Selecting "Custom model..." cleared the model to empty, which hid the text input. Fixed for both advisor and executor selectors.

### Agent Skills (SKILL.md)
- **Skills now save to disk**: Imported SKILL.md files stored in `~/.skales-data/agent-skills/` with manifest tracking.
- **Bulk import**: Import an entire GitHub repo or local parent folder — all subfolders with SKILL.md are imported at once.
- **@-mention in chat**: Type `@` to see a dropdown of installed skills. Select one to inject its SKILL.md content as context for that message. Multiple skills supported.
- **Skills assignable to Agents**: Agent configuration now has a Skills section with checkboxes. Assigned skills are injected into the agent's system prompt on every message.
- **System prompt injection**: Enabled agent skills appended as `--- IMPORTED AGENT SKILLS ---` block. Works in Chat, Spotlight, Browser, Codework, and Organization.

### Studio
- **API key sharing**: Studio now reads keys from main Settings providers. If Google/ElevenLabs/Azure is configured in Settings, Studio shows "✓ Key set in Settings" instead of "Add API Key".
- **Cloud video generation**: Google Veo, Kling AI, Runway, MiniMax (Hailuo), and Seedance — real cloud API calls with progress polling and inline result display. No longer "Coming Soon".
- **Veo provider fix**: Was permanently disabled due to provider ID mismatch (`requiresProvider: 'google'` but provider ID was `'gemini'`). Fixed.
- **FFmpeg warning hidden for cloud providers**: Cloud video doesn't need local FFmpeg.

### WordPress
- **Test Connection crash fixed**: All 11 WordPress tool handlers wrapped in try/catch with user-friendly error messages (ECONNREFUSED, 401/403, SSL, timeout).
- **Full-width CSS v2**: `body.skales-page` class added via `body_class` filter. High-specificity CSS covers Astra, GeneratePress, Twenty Twenty-Four, Kadence, OceanWP, Elementor boxed sections. `the_content` wrapper as last-resort override.
- **`_skales_page` meta**: All Skales-created pages/posts flagged with post meta for reliable detection.
- **AI Command Bar reliability**: Rewritten multi-step system prompt with explicit workflows for UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, REDESIGN. "Never guess page IDs" rule. MAX_WP_ITERATIONS increased from 5 to 8.
- **Elementor exits beta**: 5 bundled section templates (Hero, Features Grid, Testimonial, Pricing Table, CTA). Template JSON examples injected into agent system prompt.
- **WordPress Connector Plugin bumped to v1.1.0**

### Slash Commands (13 new, 24 total)
- `/memory` — show memory summary (name, interests, goals, projects)
- `/skills` — list installed agent skills with enabled/disabled status
- `/provider` — show active provider, model, and base URL
- `/version` — show Skales version
- `/export` — export current chat as markdown file download
- `/theme` — toggle dark/light mode
- `/language` — show current locale
- `/settings`, `/discover`, `/studio`, `/codework`, `/wordpress` — quick navigation
- `/status` — system status check (provider, Ollama, integrations, WordPress)

### Identity Maintenance
- **Runs silently**: `silent: true` flag on system tasks. No "SECURITY GATE" approval prompts. No dramatic messaging. One-line summary only.

### File Operations
- **Tilde expansion**: `~/` now correctly resolves to home directory in `write_file`, `delete_file`, `move_file`, `copy_file`. Previously only worked in `read_file` and `create_directory`.

### Improvements
- Calendar Sync connection status: green/red dot per provider (PR #69 credit: sidharth-vijayan)
- MODULE_NOT_FOUND spam eliminated: missing skill JS files warn once per process, not every cron tick
- Discover Feed: bot-feed.php optimized with `readJsonlTail()` for all feed reads
- ElevenLabs settings link corrected (pointed to Providers, now points to Integrations)
- 13 new slash command descriptions added to all 12 locale files

- 12 WordPress tools registered in orchestrator with full ReAct loop (`wpAgentCommand`)

### Stability & Performance
- **Chat loop dedup fix**: Duplicate tool call detection in chat page's agent loop (exact args dedup + tool name cap at 3)
- **Tool filter**: Context-based tool filtering (`filterToolsForContext`) reduces 70+ tools to ~10-15 per call based on message content keywords
- **MAX_LOOPS reduced**: 20 → 10 (real tasks complete in <8 iterations)
- **Skill loading safety**: Missing .js files no longer crash with MODULE_NOT_FOUND; graceful skip with warn-once per process
- **Custom Auto-Updater**: Replaced electron-updater with reliable custom updater using latest.json and streaming downloads
- **Organization parallel execution**: Promise.all for independent subtasks
- **Anthropic timeout**: Increased from 90s to 120s for large tool payloads

### New Features

- Sidebar grouped into Main/Tools/System sections with always-visible tooltips
- Skills renamed to "Add-Ons" with Activate/Deactivate All
- useModels shared hook: fresh models everywhere (not hardcoded)
- Dark mode persistence: cookie + settings.json double-save
- Templates cache (localStorage + server-side)
- 12 locale files with 50+ new i18n keys
- BSL-1.1 license clarification header

### Bug Fixes
- Tool-call infinite loop (was in chat/page.tsx, not orchestrator.ts — hard cap moved before execution)
- Browser links opening new windows (new-window event + DOM override)
- save-file-dialog IPC handler registered
- Settings search covers all new sections (WordPress, Advisor, Dreaming, Memory)
- Sidebar tooltip always visible (PR #64 credit: sidharth-vijayan)
- Settings replaceState crash on Next.js 14 (try/catch wrapper)
- Studio: Black image, video preview centering, gallery download, reference image handling
- Browser: Session isolation, privacy dropdown, history clear, new tab crash

---

## v7.6.6 — Hotfix (March 2026)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Discover Feed tool events never fired** — When users opted in to Discover on the /discover page, the `discoverOptedIn`, `discoverTag`, and `discoverAnonymousId` fields were only saved to localStorage (client-side) but never synced to `settings.json` (server-side). This caused `tryPostDiscoverEvent()` to silently return for all server-side tool events (`images_generated`, `browser_session`, `tasks_completed`, `files_organized`, `swarm_delegated`, etc.). Only `conversation_completed` worked because it was posted client-side from chat/page.tsx. Fix: opt-in now syncs to settings.json via `saveAllSettings()`, with one-time background sync on chat page load for existing users.

## v7.6.5 — The Intelligence Update (March 2026)

### New Features
- **Token Compressor** — 3-level system prompt compression (Full/Compact/Minimal) to reduce API token usage by up to 70%. Configurable in Settings. Level 2 (Minimal) is ideal for Spotlight and quick tasks.
- **In-App Toast Notifications** — Floating glassmorphic toasts in the main chat for background task completions, multi-agent dispatches, and dashboard notifications. Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds.
- **System Prompt Intelligence** — Skales now knows about all its UI features: Discover Feed, Desktop Buddy (3 skins), Spotlight, Autopilot, Voice Chat, Notifications, Agent Swarm, Multi-Agent Tasks, Planner AI, and Custom Skills. Can navigate users to the correct pages.
- **Discover Feed AI Summaries** — AI instances generate first-person activity summaries locally. Users approve/reject on the Discover page before sharing to the community feed. Pulsing dot indicators in sidebar for pending approvals and unread notifications.
- **Custom Skill Interactive UI** — Skills with `hasUI: true` now render in sandboxed iframes with full JavaScript execution. Bridge API: `skales.rerun()`, `skales.navigate()`, `skales.send()` for skill-to-host communication.

### New Features (cont.)
- **Skales Wrapped** — Spotify-style weekly stats card. Auto-generates every Monday at 8am or on-demand. Two shareable formats: Square (1:1) and Story (9:16). Client-side PNG generation with html2canvas. 4 theme-matched card designs (Skales/Obsidian/Snowfield/Neon). Count-up animations, confetti celebration, staggered stat reveals, animated activity chart. 9 personality badges (On Fire, Power User, Night Owl, etc.). Download PNG, Copy to Clipboard, or Post to Discover. Sidebar pulsing dot when new data. Fully localized in all 9 languages.
- **Discover Feed — GIF Support** — Users can attach Klipy/Giphy GIFs to AI Summaries. GIF preview in pending approval, overflow-safe rendering in feed cards. Admin panel (view.php) shows GIF URLs and reply-to quotes.

- **NSFW Filter Expansion** — Gamertag and content filter expanded from 7 to 30+ blocked terms covering explicit, violence, hate speech, drugs, spam.
- **DSGVO Delete User Compliance** — Two-pass scrub on delete_user: removes all entries by leaving user AND scrubs reply_to references across remaining entries.
- **Admin Panel v6** — Brute-force rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 min), CSRF tokens on all forms, security headers (X-Frame-Options: DENY, CSP, XSS-Protection), session hardening
- **API Rate Limiting** — report-status.php (60 req/5min), notifications.php (120 req/5min) with 429 responses and Retry-After headers
- **Input Validation** — anonymous_id format validation (regex) on all public endpoints

### Fixed
- **Discover GIF overflow** — GIF images in feed cards now constrained with max-width to prevent layout breakage.
- **Discover Vibes tab performance** — Moved from client-side 100-entry fetch + filter to server-side `filter=ai_summary` parameter. Reduces bandwidth and improves load time.
- **Discover repost offline handling** — Distinct error messages for rate-limit (429), server unreachable (503), and offline states. Graceful degradation for deleted-entry reposts.
- **Admin mobile access** — Burger menu for mobile viewports, sidebar slides in from left with overlay

- **Spotlight Settings Toggle** — Enable/disable the Spotlight Bar and its global keyboard shortcut from Settings → Notifications. Setting persists across restarts. Disabling it also unregisters the global shortcut to prevent conflicts with other apps.
- **Mini-Chat Mode** — Shrink Skales to a compact always-on-top chat window. Toggle from the chat header or use the Spotlight shortcut.

- **Cookie Consent** — Landing page cookie banner with Google Consent Mode v2. Default deny for analytics/ad storage, granted on explicit Accept.

### Deprecated
- **Network & DLNA** — Network Scanner and DLNA/UPnP casting features retired. The /network route now redirects to Swarm. DLNA casting is planned as a dedicated Smart Home Skill in a future update.

### Fixed

## v7.1.0 - "The Local AI Update" (March 2026)

### Bug Fixes
- **Telegram Approval Loop:** Fixed infinite loop where approving an action in Telegram
  triggered the same approval again. Approval responses now route correctly and don't
  trigger memory scans.
- **IPv6 localhost:** Fixed bot->server connection failure on systems where localhost
  resolves to ::1 instead of 127.0.0.1. All bot files now use 127.0.0.1 explicitly.
  (Thanks @bmp-jaller)
- **Think Tags:** Fixed <think> blocks leaking into chat responses from Qwen/DeepSeek
  models via KoboldCpp. Both <think> and <thinking> variants now stripped.
  (Thanks @henk717)
- **Desktop Buddy Approve:** Fixed approve button showing "cancelled" due to sandbox
  restrictions not being communicated. Input field no longer overlaps approval buttons.

- **Onboarding Renamed:** "Custom Endpoint" -> "OpenAI Compatible" (moved above Ollama).
  KoboldCpp, LM Studio, vLLM are now first-class options, not hidden under "Custom."
- **API Key Truly Optional:** Empty key = no auth header sent. Local AI servers
  that don't need authentication work without workarounds.

  XTTS-API-Server). Not limited to cloud providers.
- **Local STT Endpoint:** Voice transcription can use local Whisper (KoboldCpp).
- **Local Image Generation:** Configurable image generation endpoint alongside Replicate.



## v7.0.1 — Hotfix (March 2026)

### Bug Fixes
- **Telegram Bot:** Fixed bot process crash on end-user machines. Bot now uses Electron's built-in Node runtime (`fork()`) instead of requiring system Node.js installation (`spawn('node')`). Affects all platforms. Same fix applied to WhatsApp bot.
- **Chat Frozen:** Fixed chat becoming unresponsive after vision model error. Session history is now sanitized before every API call, preventing corrupted message blocks from breaking subsequent requests.
- **Streaming Timeout:** Added 60-second inactivity timeout to prevent chat UI from hanging permanently on broken API responses.
- **Vision Fallback:** When a model doesn't support vision, images are now stripped gracefully and the message is sent as text-only instead of corrupting the session.

## V6.2.0 - "The Telegram Fix" (March 2026)

### Critical Fixes
- Fixed: Endless Telegram approval loop — 9 tools (check_system_status, check_capabilities, check_identity, fetch_skales_docs, analyze_image, generate_voice, update_capabilities, enable_skill, disable_skill) missing from TOOL_SAFETY map caused read-only tools to require approval every call
- Fixed: TOOL_SAFETY fallback changed from 'confirm' to 'auto' — new tools no longer silently block with a console warning for unmapped tools
- Fixed: Telegram session history now preserves tool results with orphan protection — LLM no longer re-calls already-executed tools
- Fixed: Google Translate TTS hardcoded to German (`tl=de`) — now uses user's configured nativeLanguage/locale

### Improvements
- Telegram approval route now re-enters agent loop for natural responses after tool execution

## V6.1.0 — "The Awakening" (March 2026)

### Autopilot — True Autonomous Agent
- **Recurring Task Scheduling**: Master Plan now generates cron jobs for recurring goals. "Check my email every morning at 8am" creates an actual scheduled task, not a one-shot.
- **Live Execution View**: New tab in Autopilot dashboard shows real-time agent reasoning, tool calls, and results as they happen. Watch Skales think.
- **Automatic Daily Stand-up**: Autopilot generates and delivers a daily briefing via Telegram every weekday at 9am (configurable). No button click needed.

### **🦎 Desktop Buddy - Floating Mascot & Spotlight Quick Action**

- **Transparent Electron Window**: A frameless, always-on-top `BrowserWindow` (400×500 px) positioned at the bottom-right corner of the primary display. No taskbar entry. No shadow. Fully draggable.
- **Finite State Machine (FSM)**: The mascot cycles through four states using `onEnded` video events: **Intro** (random welcome clip on launch) → **Idle** (looping base animation) → **Action** (random shuffle-bag clip every 45-90 s, never repeats until all played) → back to **Idle**. Clicking the mascot triggers **Query** state with the Attentive animation looping.
- **Spotlight Quick Input**: Glassmorphism input field with backdrop blur, lime-green glow border, and animated loading spinner. Random Skales-flavoured placeholders rotate on each open. Press Enter to submit, Escape to dismiss.
- **AI Response Bubble**: The AI reply is shown as a glassmorphism speech bubble with a pointer tail, auto-dismissed after 10 seconds (click to dismiss early). Replies are trimmed to 120 characters for readability.
- **Silent Session DB Sync**: Every question and answer is silently appended to `DATA_DIR/buddy/YYYY-MM-DD.json` via the new `/api/buddy-memory` route. No UI feedback, no interruption.
- **Settings Toggle**: Added 🦎 **Desktop Buddy** toggle in **Settings → Desktop App** (Electron-only section). Uses `skales.send('set-desktop-buddy', bool)` IPC. State persists in-memory via `desktopBuddyEnabled` flag in `main.js`.
- **Smart Visibility**: Buddy window appears when the main window is minimized or hidden, and hides when the main window is restored or shown. Toggling off instantly hides the buddy.

### **⭐ Autopilot - The Autonomous Chief of Staff**

- **🤖 Autopilot Dashboard**: Brand-new dedicated page (`/autopilot`) with four sections: Control Room, Execution Board, Identity & Memory, and Live History. Accessible via the gold-highlighted sidebar item.
- **🎤 Deep-Dive Interview**: Multi-turn LLM interview that learns your primary goal, niche, budget, and constraints. Saves profile to `user_profile.json`. Starts with a randomised epic call-to-action button.
- **🗺️ Master Plan Generation**: LLM generates a structured roadmap + task list from your profile. Tasks are pushed directly onto the Execution Board.
- **🔁 OODA Self-Correction Loop**: If a sub-task discovers new context (dead website, changed pricing, failed dependency), Autopilot autonomously rewrites, deletes, or reprioritises pending tasks and logs the reason with a full audit trail (`replanReason` / `replannedAt`).
- **🛡️ Human-in-the-Loop Approval Gates**: Tasks involving mass communications, file deletion, or financial transactions are auto-flagged (`requires_approval`). The runner pauses them until the user clicks Approve or Reject on the Execution Board.
- **💰 API Cost Control**: Configurable max LLM calls per hour (`maxCallsPerHour`) and "pause after N tasks" (`pauseAfterTasks`) session counter. If a limit is hit, Autopilot pauses and waits for user acknowledgment - no silent API overspend.
- **🔄 Anti-Loop Protocol**: Automatic retry tracking (`retryCount` / `maxRetries` = 3). After 3 consecutive failures a task is permanently `blocked` with a `blockedReason`, never retried again.
- **🗞️ Daily Stand-Up Report**: LLM generates a first-person morning briefing from completed, blocked, and in-progress tasks, plus recent log entries.
- **📋 Execution Board (Kanban)**: Full CRUD for tasks - Add, Edit, Cancel, Delete. Filter by state. Shows provider/model, re-plan badge, priority selector, and per-task approve/reject UI.
- **📟 Live History Terminal**: Dark terminal-style log viewer (`autopilot_logs.json`). Colour-coded by level (info/success/warning/error). Auto-polls every 8 seconds. Rolling 500-entry cap.

### **🧠 Meta-Agent - Universal Skill Dispatcher**

- **🔌 Headless Skill Execution**: Autopilot is a meta-agent with programmatic, isolated access to every active skill. All background executions never touch the foreground UI, chat history, or active sessions.
- **🤝 Internal Group Chat**: Spawns parallel LLM calls with different personas to reach a consensus on complex decisions.
- **`[SKILL:xxx key="val"]` Syntax**: Tasks can explicitly route to a specific skill handler via tag syntax in their description.
- **Skill Handlers**: `web_search`, `documents`, `network_scanner`, `email`, `twitter`, `googleCalendar`, `ooda_replan`, `internal_group_chat`.

### **🎙️ Voice Chat Interface**

- **Mic Button**: Amber-styled microphone button between New Session and History (visible only when Voice Chat skill is active).
- **Voice Chat Mode**: Dedicated fullscreen input overlay with status labels (Idle → Recording → Transcribing → Thinking → Speaking), animated pulse ring when recording.
- **Whisper Transcription**: Routes to Groq Whisper first, falls back to OpenAI Whisper. Endpoint: `/api/voice/transcribe`.
- **TTS Playback**: ElevenLabs TTS with browser SpeechSynthesis fallback.

### **🧩 Skill AI - Custom Skill Ecosystem**

- **ZIP Upload**: Upload a `.skill.zip` to install a completely new capability. Skales extracts, validates, and hot-reloads without restart.
- **AI Scaffolding**: Describe a skill in plain language - Skales generates the full skill definition, handler code, and metadata automatically.
- **Skills Page**: Manage installed custom skills - enable/disable, view metadata, delete. Isolated sandboxed execution.
- **Security Warning**: All uploaded skills display a security advisory banner before activation.

### **📄 Documents Generation**

- **Word (.docx)**: Generate fully-formatted Word documents from natural language using the `docx` library.
- **PDF**: Every document request simultaneously generates a PDF version via `pdf-lib`.
- **Excel (.xlsx)**: Create spreadsheets with data, formulas, and formatting via the `xlsx` library.
- **Output**: Files saved to `DATA_DIR/documents/` and linked directly in the chat response.

### **🗺️ Google Places**

- **Nearby Search**: Find restaurants, shops, services near any address or coordinates.
- **Place Details**: Fetch business hours, ratings, reviews, website, phone number.
- **Geocoding**: Convert addresses to coordinates and vice versa.
- **Directions**: Get turn-by-turn navigation data between two points.
- **Photo URLs**: Retrieve Google Places photo references.
- **Implementation**: Pure REST API fetch - no Google SDK, no native binaries.

### **🌐 Network Scanner**

- **LAN Discovery**: Scans all 254 addresses in the local subnet using raw `net.connect()` (pure Node.js - no nmap, no shell).
- **Port Detection**: Reports open ports per device. Specifically detects other Skales instances on port 3000.
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/network-scan` with configurable subnet and port list.

### **📺 Media Casting (DLNA/UPnP)**

- **SSDP Discovery**: Finds DLNA/UPnP media renderers on the LAN using `node-ssdp`.
- **AVTransport Control**: Play, Pause, Stop, Seek, and Set Volume on discovered devices via raw UPnP SOAP over HTTP.
- **Zero native binaries**: Pure Node.js - no `castv2-client`, no `mdns`, no Chromecast SDK.

### **🔧 v5 Polish - Stability, Identity & Infrastructure**

- **Proactive Check-In Cron Loop**: Added `tickCronJobs()` to the autonomous runner heartbeat. Cron jobs in `CRON_DIR` now automatically fire on their schedule without requiring a separate cron runner process. In-memory dedup (`cronLastRanAt` Map) prevents double-fires within 55 minutes.
- **Voice Chat Mic Crash (HTTP Guard)**: Added `if (!navigator.mediaDevices?.getUserMedia)` guard in `startRecording()`. Users on plain HTTP now receive a clear error message instead of a silent crash: *"Microphone access requires a secure connection (HTTPS or localhost)."*
- **Windows App User Model ID**: Added `app.setAppUserModelId('Skales')` for Windows before the single-instance lock. Toast notifications and taskbar entries now display "Skales" instead of the Electron app ID.
- **Capabilities Registry v5.0.0**: Bumped version to `5.0.0`, corrected `twitter` and `safety_mode` `SkillDef` shapes, added 7 new v5 skills: `autopilot`, `custom_skills`, `places`, `documents`, `voice_chat`, `network_scanner`, `casting`.
- **Mobile UI Polish**: Removed `"Talking to: "` prefix from the agent selector. Added `hidden md:inline` to New Session / Voice / History header button text so icons-only appear on mobile.
- **Network & Devices Page** (`/network`): New full `'use client'` page with two tabs - **Network Scanner** (mode selector: info/skales/full, live device list with Skales-flag badge) and **DLNA Casting** (discover renderers, device picker, cast/pause/stop controls). Added `Network` icon and sidebar entry.
- **Skill AI Enhancements**: Added `requiresApiKeys` toggle in the Custom Skills generation UI. Enabled `requiredSecrets` array in the generated skill manifest. Added a conditional UI Playbook block (CSS variables, Tailwind guidance, lucide-react tips) injected into the system prompt when `hasUI: true`.
- **Fluid Identity System Prompt**: Rewrote `buildContext()` in `identity.ts` from markdown bullets to a flowing narrative wrapped in an HTML comment. Includes current time, who Skales is, who the user is, key learnings, and recent memory highlights.
- **Agent-to-Agent Protocol** (`/api/agent-sync`): New route supporting `ping`, `handshake`, `delegate`, and `status` operations. Optional `SKALES_AGENT_SECRET` environment variable for bearer authentication. Task delegation via `createTask()`, status queries via `getTask()`.

### **🛡️ Wake-Up Crash Fix (ErrorBoundary + Polling Guards)**

- **Global ErrorBoundary** (`src/components/error-boundary.tsx`): React class component wrapping `<AppShell>`. Catches render errors via `getDerivedStateFromError`, async errors via `window.unhandledrejection` (ignores `AbortError`). Renders a Skales-themed fallback with 🦎 icon and "↺ Reload Skales" button.
- **Polling Guards** - `document.hidden` check + `visibilitychange` listener added to:
  - `chat/page.tsx`: voice `setInterval`, video poll `setTimeout` chain (with `try/catch` retry), Telegram poll effect.
  - `notification-manager.tsx`: `checkInbox`, `checkCalendarReminders`, `runMemoryScan`.
  - `app-shell.tsx`: `checkEmail`.

### **📦 New Dependencies**

- `xlsx` ^0.18.5 - Excel generation
- `docx` ^8.5.0 - Word document generation
- `pdf-lib` ^1.17.1 - PDF generation
- `node-ssdp` ^4.0.1 - SSDP device discovery

## **4.0.0** - The Desktop Edition (February 2026)

### **New Features**

- **🖥️ Native Desktop App**: Skales is now a proper desktop application for Windows and macOS, built with Electron. Install it once - no terminal, no manual server starts, no browser required. Launch it like any other app.
- **🔒 Single-Instance Lock**: Opening Skales a second time now focuses the existing window instead of spawning a duplicate process.
- **⚡ Smart Port Detection**: If port 3000 is occupied, Skales automatically tries 3001 and 3002 before failing gracefully - no more manual port conflicts.
- **🌅 Launch at Login**: New toggle in Settings → Desktop App to start Skales automatically when you log in. Works on both Windows (registry) and macOS (Login Items) via Electron's native API.
- **🛑 Graceful Shutdown**: Skales now sends SIGTERM to the internal Next.js server on quit and waits up to 5 seconds for in-flight tasks to finish before force-killing. No more torn bot sessions or half-written data on exit.
- **🪟 Hidden CMD Window (Windows)**: The internal Next.js server process no longer flashes a console window on Windows startup.
- **🍎 macOS Info.plist**: The `.app` bundle now includes proper copyright, version strings, privacy usage descriptions, and local networking permissions in `Info.plist`.
- **📁 Home Directory Data Storage**: All user data (`.skales-data`) now stored in the user's home directory, not inside the app bundle. Data persists across updates and reinstalls.
- **🔧 Centralized Path Resolution**: Single `paths.ts` module ensures consistent data directory across all 34 source files.
- **🍎 macOS Backup Fix**: ZIP import no longer crashes on macOS (replaced Python script with native Base64-encoded extraction).

### **Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: ZIP Import now forcefully overwrites existing data for full recovery
- Fixed: App performs full relaunch after backup import to clear Next.js cache
- Fixed: All 34 source files now use centralized DATA_DIR from paths.ts

### **📦 No New Dependencies**

All new features implemented using Electron's built-in APIs (`app.requestSingleInstanceLock`, `app.setLoginItemSettings`, Node's `net` module).

## **3.5.0** - The Connections Update (February 2026)

### **New Features**

- **🐦 X / Twitter Integration**: Connect your Twitter/X account via OAuth 1.0a. Skales can post tweets, read your timeline, fetch @mentions, and reply to tweets - from the chat interface or via Telegram. Full CRUD with three permission modes: Send Only, Read & Write, Full Autonomous. API keys stored securely in `.skales-data/integrations/`.
- **🛡️ Safety Mode**: Three-level command safety system (Safe / Advanced / Unrestricted). Safe mode blocks destructive shell commands (rm -rf, format, dd, fork bombs, etc.) outright. Advanced mode pauses dangerous commands and asks for Approve/Reject. Unrestricted mode disables all blocking for power users.
- **📱 OpenRouter Telegram Vision Fix**: Image uploads via Telegram now work correctly when OpenRouter is the active provider. Skales auto-detects non-vision-capable models and falls back to `openai/gpt-4o-mini` for vision tasks.
- **🔗 Secure Clipboard Fallback**: Clipboard copy now works on HTTP/Tailscale connections (not just HTTPS) by falling back to a textarea-based execCommand copy when the Clipboard API is unavailable.

### **Bug Fixes & Improvements**

- Fixed `crypto.randomUUID()` breaking on HTTP connections (Tailscale/LAN IPs) - replaced with a secure Math.random fallback across all platforms.
- Fixed mobile input bar disappearing behind the keyboard on iOS/Android.
- Fixed chat scroll-jump when new messages arrive while scrolled up.
- Fixed hydration mismatch on mobile chat page caused by SSR/client render differences.
- Fixed Telegram memory wordcloud rendering edge case.

- Email: Trusted Address Book feature, HTML email rendering, IMAP namespace fix, timezone normalization for event timestamps.
- ElevenLabs TTS fallback chain improved - now gracefully falls back to Google TTS on API errors.
- macOS: `uninstall.sh` renamed to `uninstall.command` for consistency with all other launcher scripts.
- Setup scripts: improved admin rights handling, clearer UX messages, better error reporting.

### **📦 No New Dependencies**

All new features implemented without adding external packages.

## **2.0.0** - 2026-02-23

### **✨ Added**

* **Message Queue:** FIFO message queue prevents message loss when Skales is busy processing. Queued messages are shown in the chat UI with a counter badge. Users can cancel individual queued messages or the currently-processing message. Works across Chat, Telegram, and WhatsApp interfaces.

* **Google Calendar Skill:** Read, create, edit, and delete Google Calendar events via OAuth. Skales can check your schedule, add events with reminders, and surface upcoming events as context in every conversation. Configurable in Settings → Skills → Google Calendar.

* **Gmail / Email Skill:** Full IMAP/SMTP email management - fetch inbox, read threads, compose, reply, search, move, and delete emails. HTML-to-text conversion for clean LLM display. Approve/reject safety gates for send and delete operations. New email notifications appear as a banner on the dashboard. Configurable in Settings → Skills → Email.

* **Bi-Temporal Memory System:** Automatic 90-minute memory scan extracts user preferences, facts, and action items from recent conversations. Memories carry both a valid-time (when the fact is true) and a transaction-time (when it was recorded). Relevant memories are injected as context before every AI response using local keyword extraction - no external embedding API required.

* **Telegram Admin Interface:** Remote-control Skales from Telegram using inline keyboard menus. Switch providers, models, and personas; toggle skills on/off; view real-time status; export conversation data. Admin-only access with PIN protection.

* **Killswitch:** Emergency hard-stop for all AI activity, triggerable via Dashboard button, Telegram `/killswitch` command, or automatically on RAM overload and detected infinite loops. Generates a detailed incident log on the desktop on activation.

* **Multi-Persona Group Chat Skill:** Multiple LLMs with distinct personas discuss a user question in sequential rounds. Fully configurable: participants, language, number of rounds, and personas. Discussions can be exported as Markdown.

* **Autonomous Execute Mode:** An opt-in mode where Skales autonomously handles complex multi-step tasks. Presents a plan for approval, then executes step-by-step with progress updates and approve/reject checkpoints for critical actions (file writes, email sends, deletions). Available via chat and Telegram.

* **Website & Search Security Blacklists:** Domain blocklist prevents Skales from fetching dangerous or inappropriate websites. Buzzword filter blocks harmful search queries before they reach the search API. Both are toggle-controlled in Settings → Security with curated default lists included. Fully customizable - add or remove entries from the UI.

* **Responsive UI:** Full mobile and tablet support across the entire dashboard. Collapsible sidebar with overlay, mobile header, touch-optimized controls, and proper viewport handling.

### **🔄 Changed**

* Upgraded internal skill registry to support new skill types (Calendar, Email, Group Chat, Execute Mode).
* Enhanced Telegram handler to support inline keyboard menus and all new admin commands.
* Memory system now runs alongside the existing knowledge base (non-breaking additive enhancement).
* Orchestrator tool safety model extended: `delete_email` → confirm, `reply_email` → confirm, `move_email` → auto, `empty_trash` → confirm.
* Email bodies are now HTML-to-text converted before being passed to the LLM for cleaner, token-efficient context.
* Dashboard email notification bar now shows a single aggregated row (count + latest sender) instead of stacking multiple banners.

### **🐛 Fixed**

* Fixed message loss when sending messages while Skales was already processing a response (all messages are now safely queued).
* Fixed security blacklist toggle switches not animating (invalid Tailwind class `translate-x-4.5` replaced with `translate-x-[18px]`).
* Fixed IMAP MOVE operation fallback - now correctly uses COPY + addFlags(\\Deleted) + expunge on servers that don't support the MOVE extension.

### **📦 New Dependencies**

* `nodemailer` ^6.9.14 - SMTP email sending (compose, reply, forward)
* `imap-simple` ^5.1.0 - IMAP email fetching, search, flag management, folder operations

* **Chat Skill Toolbar:** Added a "Sparkles" icon to the chat input to easily access generation panels.  
* **Smooth Preloader:** Added elegant loading animations (Spin-Ring, Gecko, Bouncing Dots) for better UX.

### **🔄 Changed**

* **Persona System Overhaul:** Completely rewrote all 5 Personas (Default, Entrepreneur, Coder, Family, Student) with 150-200 word deep-dive prompts to give them distinct, self-improving voices.  
* **Agentic Loop Enhancements:** Increased MAX\_LOOPS to 20 to allow Skales to handle highly complex, multi-file tasks. Added a visual step-indicator and fixed the stuck-state UI bug.  
* **File System Security Toggle:** Added a strict toggle in Settings (Workspace Only vs. Full Access) to sandbox file operations.  
* **Self-Awareness (Capabilities Registry v1.4):** Skales can now natively audit its own physical connections, verify identity files, and report on system health via tools.  
* **Decoupled Notifications:** The internal scheduler is no longer hard-tied to Telegram, allowing for a universal system inbox.

### **🐛 Fixed**

* Fixed Groq TTS issues by establishing a primary HTTP POST pipeline with a robust Google TTS (Translate) fallback.  
* Auto-switch logic for Vision models now correctly triggers when images are pasted or uploaded.  
* Fixed the "Enter to send" behavior when images are attached in the chat input.
