## v9.2.0 — "The Bridge" (April 2026)
### WordPress Integration (NEW)
- Skales Connector Plugin (MIT-licensed) for WordPress sites

### Stability & Performance
- **Chat loop dedup fix**: Duplicate tool call detection in chat page's agent loop (exact args dedup + tool name cap at 3)
- **Tool filter**: Context-based tool filtering (`filterToolsForContext`) reduces 70+ tools to ~10-15 per call based on message content keywords
- **MAX_LOOPS reduced**: 20 → 10 (real tasks complete in <8 iterations)
- **Skill loading safety**: Missing .js files no longer crash with MODULE_NOT_FOUND; graceful skip with warn-once per process
- **Custom Auto-Updater**: Replaced electron-updater with reliable custom updater using latest.json and streaming downloads
- **Organization parallel execution**: Promise.all for independent subtasks
- **Anthropic timeout**: Increased from 90s to 120s for large tool payloads
### New Features
- **Advisor Strategy**: Opus/GPT-5 for planning, Sonnet/Haiku for execution

- **Codework v2**: Multi-file workspace
- **Lio AI v2**: Template gallery
- **FFmpeg + Playwright**: One-click install buttons in Settings, dynamic version detection
### Improvements
- Settings page reorganized: Memory tab, Studio tab, proper grouping
- Sidebar grouped into Main/Tools/System sections with always-visible tooltips
- Skills renamed to "Add-Ons" with Activate/Deactivate All
- useModels shared hook: fresh models everywhere (not hardcoded)
- Dark mode persistence: cookie + settings.json double-save
- Templates cache (localStorage + server-side)
- 12 locale files with 50+ new i18n keys
- BSL-1.1 license clarification header
### Bug Fixes
- Tool-call infinite loop (was in chat/page.tsx, not orchestrator.ts — hard cap moved before execution)
- Browser links opening new windows (new-window event + DOM override)
- save-file-dialog IPC handler registered
- Settings search covers all new sections (WordPress, Advisor, Dreaming, Memory)
- Sidebar tooltip always visible (PR #64 credit: sidharth-vijayan)
- Settings replaceState crash on Next.js 14 (try/catch wrapper)
- Studio: Black image, video preview centering, gallery download, reference image handling
- Browser: Session isolation, privacy dropdown, history clear, new tab crash
- Theme + locale persistence to settings.json (survives localStorage wipes)
- ONNX runtime webpack warnings suppressed
### Technical
- electron-builder.yml v9.2.0
- Capabilities/system prompt v9.2.0
- Playwright detection unified (dynamic version scanning)
- DNA markers verified intact
- WordPress plugin: /skalesapp/wordpress (MIT license, kses filters bypassed for full HTML)

## v7.6.6 — Hotfix (March 2026)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Discover Feed tool events never fired** — When users opted in to Discover on the /discover page, the `discoverOptedIn`, `discoverTag`, and `discoverAnonymousId` fields were only saved to localStorage (client-side) but never synced to `settings.json` (server-side). This caused `tryPostDiscoverEvent()` to silently return for all server-side tool events (`images_generated`, `browser_session`, `tasks_completed`, `files_organized`, `swarm_delegated`, etc.). Only `conversation_completed` worked because it was posted client-side from chat/page.tsx. Fix: opt-in now syncs to settings.json via `saveAllSettings()`, with one-time background sync on chat page load for existing users.

---

## v7.6.5 — The Intelligence Update (March 2026)

### New Features
- **Token Compressor** — 3-level system prompt compression (Full/Compact/Minimal) to reduce API token usage by up to 70%. Configurable in Settings. Level 2 (Minimal) is ideal for Spotlight and quick tasks.
- **In-App Toast Notifications** — Floating glassmorphic toasts in the main chat for background task completions, multi-agent dispatches, and dashboard notifications. Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds.
- **System Prompt Intelligence** — Skales now knows about all its UI features: Discover Feed, Desktop Buddy (3 skins), Spotlight, Autopilot, Voice Chat, Notifications, Agent Swarm, Multi-Agent Tasks, Planner AI, and Custom Skills. Can navigate users to the correct pages.
- **Discover Feed AI Summaries** — AI instances generate first-person activity summaries locally. Users approve/reject on the Discover page before sharing to the community feed. Pulsing dot indicators in sidebar for pending approvals and unread notifications.
- **Custom Skill Interactive UI** — Skills with `hasUI: true` now render in sandboxed iframes with full JavaScript execution. Bridge API: `skales.rerun()`, `skales.navigate()`, `skales.send()` for skill-to-host communication.

### New Features (cont.)
- **Skales Wrapped** — Spotify-style weekly stats card. Auto-generates every Monday at 8am or on-demand. Two shareable formats: Square (1:1) and Story (9:16). Client-side PNG generation with html2canvas. 4 theme-matched card designs (Skales/Obsidian/Snowfield/Neon). Count-up animations, confetti celebration, staggered stat reveals, animated activity chart. 9 personality badges (On Fire, Power User, Night Owl, etc.). Download PNG, Copy to Clipboard, or Post to Discover. Sidebar pulsing dot when new data. Fully localized in all 9 languages.
- **Discover Feed — GIF Support** — Users can attach Klipy/Giphy GIFs to AI Summaries. GIF preview in pending approval, overflow-safe rendering in feed cards. Admin panel (view.php) shows GIF URLs and reply-to quotes.

- **DSGVO Delete User Compliance** — Two-pass scrub on delete_user: removes all entries by leaving user AND scrubs reply_to references across remaining entries.
- **Admin Panel v6** — Brute-force rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 min), CSRF tokens on all forms, security headers (X-Frame-Options: DENY, CSP, XSS-Protection), session hardening
- **API Rate Limiting** — report-status.php (60 req/5min), notifications.php (120 req/5min) with 429 responses and Retry-After headers
- **Input Validation** — anonymous_id format validation (regex) on all public endpoints

### Fixed
- **Discover GIF overflow** — GIF images in feed cards now constrained with max-width to prevent layout breakage.
- **Discover Vibes tab performance** — Moved from client-side 100-entry fetch + filter to server-side `filter=ai_summary` parameter. Reduces bandwidth and improves load time.
- **Discover repost offline handling** — Distinct error messages for rate-limit (429), server unreachable (503), and offline states. Graceful degradation for deleted-entry reposts.

### Infrastructure
- Discover queue: flat-file pending queue with self-throttling guards (4h cooldown, max 3 pending, min 3 activities)
- Activity log capped at 500 entries
- Admin dashboard: purge bots, purge all, AI Summary detection with lime badges

## v7.1.0 - "The Local AI Update" (March 2026)

### Bug Fixes
- **Telegram Approval Loop:** Fixed infinite loop where approving an action in Telegram
  triggered the same approval again. Approval responses now route correctly and don't
  trigger memory scans.
- **IPv6 localhost:** Fixed bot->server connection failure on systems where localhost
  resolves to ::1 instead of 127.0.0.1. All bot files now use 127.0.0.1 explicitly.
  (Thanks @bmp-jaller)
- **Think Tags:** Fixed <think> blocks leaking into chat responses from Qwen/DeepSeek
  models via KoboldCpp. Both <think> and <thinking> variants now stripped.
  (Thanks @henk717)
- **Desktop Buddy Approve:** Fixed approve button showing "cancelled" due to sandbox
  restrictions not being communicated. Input field no longer overlaps approval buttons.
- **Auto-Updater:** Honest message - "Download at skales.app" instead of false
  "will install automatically" claim.

### Improvements
- **Onboarding Renamed:** "Custom Endpoint" -> "OpenAI Compatible" (moved above Ollama).
  KoboldCpp, LM Studio, vLLM are now first-class options, not hidden under "Custom."
- **API Key Truly Optional:** Empty key = no auth header sent. Local AI servers
  that don't need authentication work without workarounds.
- **Local TTS Endpoint:** Voice settings now support local TTS servers (KoboldCpp,
  XTTS-API-Server). Not limited to cloud providers.
- **Local STT Endpoint:** Voice transcription can use local Whisper (KoboldCpp).
- **Local Image Generation:** Configurable image generation endpoint alongside Replicate.

## v7.0.1 — Hotfix (March 2026)

### Bug Fixes
- **Telegram Bot:** Fixed bot process crash on end-user machines. Bot now uses Electron's built-in Node runtime (`fork()`) instead of requiring system Node.js installation (`spawn('node')`). Affects all platforms. Same fix applied to WhatsApp bot.
- **Chat Frozen:** Fixed chat becoming unresponsive after vision model error. Session history is now sanitized before every API call, preventing corrupted message blocks from breaking subsequent requests.
- **Streaming Timeout:** Added 60-second inactivity timeout to prevent chat UI from hanging permanently on broken API responses.
- **Vision Fallback:** When a model doesn't support vision, images are now stripped gracefully and the message is sent as text-only instead of corrupting the session.

## V6.2.0 - "The Telegram Fix" (March 2026)

### Critical Fixes
- Fixed: Endless Telegram approval loop — 9 tools (check_system_status, check_capabilities, check_identity, fetch_skales_docs, analyze_image, generate_voice, update_capabilities, enable_skill, disable_skill) missing from TOOL_SAFETY map caused read-only tools to require approval every call
- Fixed: TOOL_SAFETY fallback changed from 'confirm' to 'auto' — new tools no longer silently block with a console warning for unmapped tools
- Fixed: Telegram session history now preserves tool results with orphan protection — LLM no longer re-calls already-executed tools
- Fixed: Google Translate TTS hardcoded to German (`tl=de`) — now uses user's configured nativeLanguage/locale

### Improvements
- Telegram approval route now re-enters agent loop for natural responses after tool execution
- Autopilot "yes"/"no" intercept now checks task age (5 min window) to prevent eating unrelated messages
- App-shell pageshow event listener properly cleaned up (memory leak fix)
- Variable shadowing fixed in Telegram callback query handler (`data` → `responseData`)
- SkalesSettings interface extended with locale, theme, buddy_skin, telemetry_enabled, telemetry_anonymous_id fields

## V6.1.1 — Hotfix (March 2026)
- Fixed: Telemetry key mismatch - /api/settings endpoint now exposes telemetry_enabled, feedback page uses correct URL
- Fixed: Feature Request textarea not editable on /feedback page (was disabled when telemetry appeared off)

- Updated: All 4 locale files (en/de/es/fr) with new privacy section keys (1010 keys each)

## V6.1.0 — "The Awakening" (March 2026)

### Autopilot — True Autonomous Agent
- **Recurring Task Scheduling**: Master Plan now generates cron jobs for recurring goals. "Check my email every morning at 8am" creates an actual scheduled task, not a one-shot.
- **Live Execution View**: New tab in Autopilot dashboard shows real-time agent reasoning, tool calls, and results as they happen. Watch Skales think.
- **Automatic Daily Stand-up**: Autopilot generates and delivers a daily briefing via Telegram every weekday at 9am (configurable). No button click needed.
- **Safe Mode: Approval Instead of Skip**: Scheduled tasks in Safe Mode now pause for approval instead of being silently skipped. Visible on the Execution Board.
- **Telegram Approval for Autopilot**: Approve or reject Autopilot tasks directly from Telegram. Reply `approve <id>` or `reject <id>`, or simple `yes`/`no` for single pending tasks.
- **Accurate API Rate Limiter**: Cost controls now count actual LLM calls per task (not 1 per task dispatch). Budget reflects real usage.

### New Features
- **Bubbles Mascot Skin**: Meet Bubbles — a playful blue liquid blob that morphs into different shapes. Selectable in Settings → Desktop Buddy alongside the original Skales gecko.
- **Feedback & Rating System**: New /feedback page with 3 sections: Rate Skales (4 emoji ratings), Report a Bug, Request a Feature. Data sent to server only with telemetry opt-in. GDPR compliant.

## **5.0.0** - The Desktop Companion Update (2026-03-02)

Skales v5.0.0 is the largest single release in the project's history. It ships the full Autopilot meta-agent, Voice Chat, a Custom Skill Ecosystem, Document Generation, Google Places, a Network Scanner, DLNA Casting, a brand-new **Desktop Buddy**, and a comprehensive v5 stability pass covering background polling crashes, Windows notification identity, mic guard on HTTP, cron scheduling, fluid identity, and multi-agent protocol.

---

### **🦎 Desktop Buddy - Floating Mascot & Spotlight Quick Action**

- **Transparent Electron Window**: A frameless, always-on-top `BrowserWindow` (400×500 px) positioned at the bottom-right corner of the primary display. No taskbar entry. No shadow. Fully draggable.
- **Finite State Machine (FSM)**: The mascot cycles through four states using `onEnded` video events: **Intro** (random welcome clip on launch) → **Idle** (looping base animation) → **Action** (random shuffle-bag clip every 45-90 s, never repeats until all played) → back to **Idle**. Clicking the mascot triggers **Query** state with the Attentive animation looping.
- **Spotlight Quick Input**: Glassmorphism input field with backdrop blur, lime-green glow border, and animated loading spinner. Random Skales-flavoured placeholders rotate on each open. Press Enter to submit, Escape to dismiss.
- **AI Response Bubble**: The AI reply is shown as a glassmorphism speech bubble with a pointer tail, auto-dismissed after 10 seconds (click to dismiss early). Replies are trimmed to 120 characters for readability.
- **Silent Session DB Sync**: Every question and answer is silently appended to `DATA_DIR/buddy/YYYY-MM-DD.json` via the new `/api/buddy-memory` route. No UI feedback, no interruption.
- **Settings Toggle**: Added 🦎 **Desktop Buddy** toggle in **Settings → Desktop App** (Electron-only section). Uses `skales.send('set-desktop-buddy', bool)` IPC. State persists in-memory via `desktopBuddyEnabled` flag in `main.js`.
- **Smart Visibility**: Buddy window appears when the main window is minimized or hidden, and hides when the main window is restored or shown. Toggling off instantly hides the buddy.

---

### **⭐ Autopilot - The Autonomous Chief of Staff**

- **🤖 Autopilot Dashboard**: Brand-new dedicated page (`/autopilot`) with four sections: Control Room, Execution Board, Identity & Memory, and Live History. Accessible via the gold-highlighted sidebar item.
- **🎤 Deep-Dive Interview**: Multi-turn LLM interview that learns your primary goal, niche, budget, and constraints. Saves profile to `user_profile.json`. Starts with a randomised epic call-to-action button.
- **🗺️ Master Plan Generation**: LLM generates a structured roadmap + task list from your profile. Tasks are pushed directly onto the Execution Board.
- **🔁 OODA Self-Correction Loop**: If a sub-task discovers new context (dead website, changed pricing, failed dependency), Autopilot autonomously rewrites, deletes, or reprioritises pending tasks and logs the reason with a full audit trail (`replanReason` / `replannedAt`).
- **🛡️ Human-in-the-Loop Approval Gates**: Tasks involving mass communications, file deletion, or financial transactions are auto-flagged (`requires_approval`). The runner pauses them until the user clicks Approve or Reject on the Execution Board.
- **💰 API Cost Control**: Configurable max LLM calls per hour (`maxCallsPerHour`) and "pause after N tasks" (`pauseAfterTasks`) session counter. If a limit is hit, Autopilot pauses and waits for user acknowledgment - no silent API overspend.
- **🔄 Anti-Loop Protocol**: Automatic retry tracking (`retryCount` / `maxRetries` = 3). After 3 consecutive failures a task is permanently `blocked` with a `blockedReason`, never retried again.
- **🗞️ Daily Stand-Up Report**: LLM generates a first-person morning briefing from completed, blocked, and in-progress tasks, plus recent log entries.
- **📋 Execution Board (Kanban)**: Full CRUD for tasks - Add, Edit, Cancel, Delete. Filter by state. Shows provider/model, re-plan badge, priority selector, and per-task approve/reject UI.
- **📟 Live History Terminal**: Dark terminal-style log viewer (`autopilot_logs.json`). Colour-coded by level (info/success/warning/error). Auto-polls every 8 seconds. Rolling 500-entry cap.

### **🧠 Meta-Agent - Universal Skill Dispatcher**

- **🔌 Headless Skill Execution**: Autopilot is a meta-agent with programmatic, isolated access to every active skill. All background executions never touch the foreground UI, chat history, or active sessions.
- **🤝 Internal Group Chat**: Spawns parallel LLM calls with different personas to reach a consensus on complex decisions.
- **`[SKILL:xxx key="val"]` Syntax**: Tasks can explicitly route to a specific skill handler via tag syntax in their description.
- **Skill Handlers**: `web_search`, `documents`, `network_scanner`, `email`, `twitter`, `googleCalendar`, `ooda_replan`, `internal_group_chat`.

### **🎙️ Voice Chat Interface**

- **Mic Button**: Amber-styled microphone button between New Session and History (visible only when Voice Chat skill is active).
- **Voice Chat Mode**: Dedicated fullscreen input overlay with status labels (Idle → Recording → Transcribing → Thinking → Speaking), animated pulse ring when recording.
- **Whisper Transcription**: Routes to Groq Whisper first, falls back to OpenAI Whisper. Endpoint: `/api/voice/transcribe`.
- **TTS Playback**: ElevenLabs TTS with browser SpeechSynthesis fallback.

### **🧩 Skill AI - Custom Skill Ecosystem**

- **ZIP Upload**: Upload a `.skill.zip` to install a completely new capability. Skales extracts, validates, and hot-reloads without restart.
- **AI Scaffolding**: Describe a skill in plain language - Skales generates the full skill definition, handler code, and metadata automatically.
- **Skills Page**: Manage installed custom skills - enable/disable, view metadata, delete. Isolated sandboxed execution.
- **Security Warning**: All uploaded skills display a security advisory banner before activation.

### **📄 Documents Generation**

- **Word (.docx)**: Generate fully-formatted Word documents from natural language using the `docx` library.
- **PDF**: Every document request simultaneously generates a PDF version via `pdf-lib`.
- **Excel (.xlsx)**: Create spreadsheets with data, formulas, and formatting via the `xlsx` library.
- **Output**: Files saved to `DATA_DIR/documents/` and linked directly in the chat response.

### **🗺️ Google Places**

- **Nearby Search**: Find restaurants, shops, services near any address or coordinates.
- **Place Details**: Fetch business hours, ratings, reviews, website, phone number.
- **Geocoding**: Convert addresses to coordinates and vice versa.
- **Directions**: Get turn-by-turn navigation data between two points.
- **Photo URLs**: Retrieve Google Places photo references.
- **Implementation**: Pure REST API fetch - no Google SDK, no native binaries.

### **🌐 Network Scanner**

- **LAN Discovery**: Scans all 254 addresses in the local subnet using raw `net.connect()` (pure Node.js - no nmap, no shell).
- **Port Detection**: Reports open ports per device. Specifically detects other Skales instances on port 3000.
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/network-scan` with configurable subnet and port list.

### **📺 Media Casting (DLNA/UPnP)**

- **SSDP Discovery**: Finds DLNA/UPnP media renderers on the LAN using `node-ssdp`.
- **AVTransport Control**: Play, Pause, Stop, Seek, and Set Volume on discovered devices via raw UPnP SOAP over HTTP.
- **Zero native binaries**: Pure Node.js - no `castv2-client`, no `mdns`, no Chromecast SDK.

### **🔧 v5 Polish - Stability, Identity & Infrastructure**

- **Proactive Check-In Cron Loop**: Added `tickCronJobs()` to the autonomous runner heartbeat. Cron jobs in `CRON_DIR` now automatically fire on their schedule without requiring a separate cron runner process. In-memory dedup (`cronLastRanAt` Map) prevents double-fires within 55 minutes.
- **Voice Chat Mic Crash (HTTP Guard)**: Added `if (!navigator.mediaDevices?.getUserMedia)` guard in `startRecording()`. Users on plain HTTP now receive a clear error message instead of a silent crash: *"Microphone access requires a secure connection (HTTPS or localhost)."*
- **Windows App User Model ID**: Added `app.setAppUserModelId('Skales')` for Windows before the single-instance lock. Toast notifications and taskbar entries now display "Skales" instead of the Electron app ID.
- **Capabilities Registry v5.0.0**: Bumped version to `5.0.0`, corrected `twitter` and `safety_mode` `SkillDef` shapes, added 7 new v5 skills: `autopilot`, `custom_skills`, `places`, `documents`, `voice_chat`, `network_scanner`, `casting`.
- **Mobile UI Polish**: Removed `"Talking to: "` prefix from the agent selector. Added `hidden md:inline` to New Session / Voice / History header button text so icons-only appear on mobile.
- **Network & Devices Page** (`/network`): New full `'use client'` page with two tabs - **Network Scanner** (mode selector: info/skales/full, live device list with Skales-flag badge) and **DLNA Casting** (discover renderers, device picker, cast/pause/stop controls). Added `Network` icon and sidebar entry.
- **Skill AI Enhancements**: Added `requiresApiKeys` toggle in the Custom Skills generation UI. Enabled `requiredSecrets` array in the generated skill manifest. Added a conditional UI Playbook block (CSS variables, Tailwind guidance, lucide-react tips) injected into the system prompt when `hasUI: true`.
- **Fluid Identity System Prompt**: Rewrote `buildContext()` in `identity.ts` from markdown bullets to a flowing narrative wrapped in an HTML comment. Includes current time, who Skales is, who the user is, key learnings, and recent memory highlights.
- **Agent-to-Agent Protocol** (`/api/agent-sync`): New route supporting `ping`, `handshake`, `delegate`, and `status` operations. Optional `SKALES_AGENT_SECRET` environment variable for bearer authentication. Task delegation via `createTask()`, status queries via `getTask()`.

### **🛡️ Wake-Up Crash Fix (ErrorBoundary + Polling Guards)**

- **Global ErrorBoundary** (`src/components/error-boundary.tsx`): React class component wrapping `<AppShell>`. Catches render errors via `getDerivedStateFromError`, async errors via `window.unhandledrejection` (ignores `AbortError`). Renders a Skales-themed fallback with 🦎 icon and "↺ Reload Skales" button.
- **Polling Guards** - `document.hidden` check + `visibilitychange` listener added to:
  - `chat/page.tsx`: voice `setInterval`, video poll `setTimeout` chain (with `try/catch` retry), Telegram poll effect.
  - `notification-manager.tsx`: `checkInbox`, `checkCalendarReminders`, `runMemoryScan`.
  - `app-shell.tsx`: `checkEmail`.

### **📦 New Dependencies**

- `xlsx` ^0.18.5 - Excel generation
- `docx` ^8.5.0 - Word document generation
- `pdf-lib` ^1.17.1 - PDF generation

## **4.0.0** - The Desktop Edition (February 2026)

### **New Features**

- **🖥️ Native Desktop App**: Skales is now a proper desktop application for Windows and macOS, built with Electron. Install it once - no terminal, no manual server starts, no browser required. Launch it like any other app.
- **🔒 Single-Instance Lock**: Opening Skales a second time now focuses the existing window instead of spawning a duplicate process.
- **⚡ Smart Port Detection**: If port 3000 is occupied, Skales automatically tries 3001 and 3002 before failing gracefully - no more manual port conflicts.
- **🌅 Launch at Login**: New toggle in Settings → Desktop App to start Skales automatically when you log in. Works on both Windows (registry) and macOS (Login Items) via Electron's native API.
- **🛑 Graceful Shutdown**: Skales now sends SIGTERM to the internal Next.js server on quit and waits up to 5 seconds for in-flight tasks to finish before force-killing. No more torn bot sessions or half-written data on exit.
- **🪟 Hidden CMD Window (Windows)**: The internal Next.js server process no longer flashes a console window on Windows startup.
- **🍎 macOS Info.plist**: The `.app` bundle now includes proper copyright, version strings, privacy usage descriptions, and local networking permissions in `Info.plist`.
- **📁 Home Directory Data Storage**: All user data (`.skales-data`) now stored in the user's home directory, not inside the app bundle. Data persists across updates and reinstalls.
- **🔧 Centralized Path Resolution**: Single `paths.ts` module ensures consistent data directory across all 34 source files.
- **🍎 macOS Backup Fix**: ZIP import no longer crashes on macOS (replaced Python script with native Base64-encoded extraction).

### **Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: ZIP Import now forcefully overwrites existing data for full recovery
- Fixed: App performs full relaunch after backup import to clear Next.js cache
- Fixed: All 34 source files now use centralized DATA_DIR from paths.ts

### **📦 No New Dependencies**

All new features implemented using Electron's built-in APIs (`app.requestSingleInstanceLock`, `app.setLoginItemSettings`, Node's `net` module).

## **3.5.0** - The Connections Update (February 2026)

### **New Features**

- **🐦 X / Twitter Integration**: Connect your Twitter/X account via OAuth 1.0a. Skales can post tweets, read your timeline, fetch @mentions, and reply to tweets - from the chat interface or via Telegram. Full CRUD with three permission modes: Send Only, Read & Write, Full Autonomous. API keys stored securely in `.skales-data/integrations/`.
- **🛡️ Safety Mode**: Three-level command safety system (Safe / Advanced / Unrestricted). Safe mode blocks destructive shell commands (rm -rf, format, dd, fork bombs, etc.) outright. Advanced mode pauses dangerous commands and asks for Approve/Reject. Unrestricted mode disables all blocking for power users.
- **📱 OpenRouter Telegram Vision Fix**: Image uploads via Telegram now work correctly when OpenRouter is the active provider. Skales auto-detects non-vision-capable models and falls back to `openai/gpt-4o-mini` for vision tasks.
- **🔗 Secure Clipboard Fallback**: Clipboard copy now works on HTTP/Tailscale connections (not just HTTPS) by falling back to a textarea-based execCommand copy when the Clipboard API is unavailable.

### **Bug Fixes & Improvements**

- Fixed `crypto.randomUUID()` breaking on HTTP connections (Tailscale/LAN IPs) - replaced with a secure Math.random fallback across all platforms.
- Fixed mobile input bar disappearing behind the keyboard on iOS/Android.
- Fixed chat scroll-jump when new messages arrive while scrolled up.
- Fixed hydration mismatch on mobile chat page caused by SSR/client render differences.
- Fixed Telegram memory wordcloud rendering edge case.
- Fixed Playwright cookie banner auto-dismiss not triggering on some pages.
- Improved proactive AI personality - Skales now occasionally initiates conversation based on context.
- Lio AI workspace fixes: invisible projects now visible, chat history preserved across sessions, failed build status resolved.
- Email: Trusted Address Book feature, HTML email rendering, IMAP namespace fix, timezone normalization for event timestamps.
- ElevenLabs TTS fallback chain improved - now gracefully falls back to Google TTS on API errors.
- macOS: `uninstall.sh` renamed to `uninstall.command` for consistency with all other launcher scripts.
- Setup scripts: improved admin rights handling, clearer UX messages, better error reporting.

### **📦 No New Dependencies**

All new features implemented without adding external packages.

## **2.0.0** - 2026-02-23

### **✨ Added**

* **Message Queue:** FIFO message queue prevents message loss when Skales is busy processing. Queued messages are shown in the chat UI with a counter badge. Users can cancel individual queued messages or the currently-processing message. Works across Chat, Telegram, and WhatsApp interfaces.

* **Google Calendar Skill:** Read, create, edit, and delete Google Calendar events via OAuth. Skales can check your schedule, add events with reminders, and surface upcoming events as context in every conversation. Configurable in Settings → Skills → Google Calendar.

* **Gmail / Email Skill:** Full IMAP/SMTP email management - fetch inbox, read threads, compose, reply, search, move, and delete emails. HTML-to-text conversion for clean LLM display. Approve/reject safety gates for send and delete operations. New email notifications appear as a banner on the dashboard. Configurable in Settings → Skills → Email.

* **Bi-Temporal Memory System:** Automatic 90-minute memory scan extracts user preferences, facts, and action items from recent conversations. Memories carry both a valid-time (when the fact is true) and a transaction-time (when it was recorded). Relevant memories are injected as context before every AI response using local keyword extraction - no external embedding API required.

* **Telegram Admin Interface:** Remote-control Skales from Telegram using inline keyboard menus. Switch providers, models, and personas; toggle skills on/off; view real-time status; export conversation data. Admin-only access with PIN protection.

* **Killswitch:** Emergency hard-stop for all AI activity, triggerable via Dashboard button, Telegram `/killswitch` command, or automatically on RAM overload and detected infinite loops. Generates a detailed incident log on the desktop on activation.

* **Multi-Persona Group Chat Skill:** Multiple LLMs with distinct personas discuss a user question in sequential rounds. Fully configurable: participants, language, number of rounds, and personas. Discussions can be exported as Markdown.

* **Autonomous Execute Mode:** An opt-in mode where Skales autonomously handles complex multi-step tasks. Presents a plan for approval, then executes step-by-step with progress updates and approve/reject checkpoints for critical actions (file writes, email sends, deletions). Available via chat and Telegram.

* **Website & Search Security Blacklists:** Domain blocklist prevents Skales from fetching dangerous or inappropriate websites. Buzzword filter blocks harmful search queries before they reach the search API. Both are toggle-controlled in Settings → Security with curated default lists included. Fully customizable - add or remove entries from the UI.

* **Responsive UI:** Full mobile and tablet support across the entire dashboard. Collapsible sidebar with overlay, mobile header, touch-optimized controls, and proper viewport handling.

### **🔄 Changed**

* Upgraded internal skill registry to support new skill types (Calendar, Email, Group Chat, Execute Mode).
* Enhanced Telegram handler to support inline keyboard menus and all new admin commands.
* Memory system now runs alongside the existing knowledge base (non-breaking additive enhancement).
* Orchestrator tool safety model extended: `delete_email` → confirm, `reply_email` → confirm, `move_email` → auto, `empty_trash` → confirm.
* Email bodies are now HTML-to-text converted before being passed to the LLM for cleaner, token-efficient context.
* Dashboard email notification bar now shows a single aggregated row (count + latest sender) instead of stacking multiple banners.

### **🐛 Fixed**

* Fixed message loss when sending messages while Skales was already processing a response (all messages are now safely queued).
* Fixed security blacklist toggle switches not animating (invalid Tailwind class `translate-x-4.5` replaced with `translate-x-[18px]`).
* Fixed IMAP MOVE operation fallback - now correctly uses COPY + addFlags(\\Deleted) + expunge on servers that don't support the MOVE extension.

### **📦 New Dependencies**

* `nodemailer` ^6.9.14 - SMTP email sending (compose, reply, forward)
* `imap-simple` ^5.1.0 - IMAP email fetching, search, flag management, folder operations

* **Skills Management Page:** New UI to toggle individual skills (Image Gen, Video Gen, Summarize, Weather) on or off.  
* **Chat Skill Toolbar:** Added a "Sparkles" icon to the chat input to easily access generation panels.  
* **Smooth Preloader:** Added elegant loading animations (Spin-Ring, Gecko, Bouncing Dots) for better UX.

### **🔄 Changed**

* **Persona System Overhaul:** Completely rewrote all 5 Personas (Default, Entrepreneur, Coder, Family, Student) with 150-200 word deep-dive prompts to give them distinct, self-improving voices.  
* **Agentic Loop Enhancements:** Increased MAX\_LOOPS to 20 to allow Skales to handle highly complex, multi-file tasks. Added a visual step-indicator and fixed the stuck-state UI bug.  
* **File System Security Toggle:** Added a strict toggle in Settings (Workspace Only vs. Full Access) to sandbox file operations.  
* **Self-Awareness (Capabilities Registry v1.4):** Skales can now natively audit its own physical connections, verify identity files, and report on system health via tools.  
* **Decoupled Notifications:** The internal scheduler is no longer hard-tied to Telegram, allowing for a universal system inbox.

### **🐛 Fixed**

* Fixed Groq TTS issues by establishing a primary HTTP POST pipeline with a robust Google TTS (Translate) fallback.  
* Auto-switch logic for Vision models now correctly triggers when images are pasted or uploaded.  
* Fixed the "Enter to send" behavior when images are attached in the chat input.
